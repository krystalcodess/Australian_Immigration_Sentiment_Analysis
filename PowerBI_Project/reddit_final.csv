I’m an Australian (born and raised) who once occupied an Australian government job similar to this and ALSO married a man born and raised in India (hey I live in India now!!) hopefully this reply can help others.
Precursor; Australians (especially Melbournians and Sydney siders) actually prefer Indian tourists to other foreigners. The Chinese are in their own bubble, the Russians are snobby, Europeans tend to remain invisible. But Indians come, spend money by going out, are often quite friendly and polite (as they’re having a great time!!) and tend to have a better attitude. However the entitled, loud, rude and mannerless Indians who do come to Sydney (in their minorities) are the ones who complain of racism (don’t get me wrong that does exist) but it’s just their lack of bloody manners which gets them treated like crap. And ANYONE in Australia with shit manners will get treated like this. You cannot go there as a tourist and complain, whinge and complain about the rules if you don’t get your way. A big no no.
Firstly you don’t get special treatment by your Indian peers just for being Indian.
Secondly, your visa was fairly rejected in the first instance. BUT, on the second time you MAYBE would have gotten approved but I think the assessing agent had valid reasons to reject it (more on that below). And I can tell you from experience that sometimes it is because of the officer looking at your application.
When I got married in Sydney and had people from India apply to come attend my wedding, I had friends in college in India with no income have their visas approved and approved QUICKLY. I had aunts with jobs studying phds have their visas rejected (but they were older and had families). I had friends earning crores have their visa come very very late.
I think what has held you back is the fact that you listed your sisters’ medical situation (as tough as it is) as a primary reason of visit. In the agents head; they might reason that if her health declines further, you might overstay your tourist visa and argue that you need to stay here longer (it happens more often than you think).
With your tourist visa, if you had just applied and said you want to visit your family, see the sights of Sydney, explore Australia, you might have had a better chance. It also helps providing an itinerary (as I had my friends who applied from India do) listing which tourism sights you planned to see.
Also I would recommend you booking a hotel and providing those references for the duration of your stay in support of your application. You can always cancel these prior as well. The agent knows you’re visiting Sydney solely for her health situation, thinking you’re going to be staying with her, who is to say you won’t overstay your visa and get an illegal job whilst staying at her house and continuing to support her? We know you won’t, but they’re judging on what they’re seeing in front of them and what they’ve seen happen THERE.
The other reason you may have gotten rejected;
To the assessing agent, your application looks valid, has good supporting evidence, but it doesn’t meet their criteria of a TOURISM VISA. It’s like you’re being asked to provide information on horses, BUT you have written exemplary information on TIGERS. Your information is correct but bro either apply for the tigers application or talk about the damn horse. No one sitting in Sydney is thinking you’re making shit up.
Australian bureaucracy is simpler than what people think. Satisfy the criteria, provide the required evidence and no one will question you. Show your income, letter of approval from your work, letter of invitation, but state that the primary reason is for TOURISM. To have a short recreational stay.
I would reapply in a while, as the previous records of application and rejection will still come up. If you reapply quickly, they’re going go to continue to think that you’re there in Sydney for a long time to support your family with very less incentive to go back. Still mention your sisters health (as you’ve officially mentioned it twice on your visa applications now) but also overstate your intention to travel. Also very firmly and clearly overstate your NEED to come back to India to continue your employment as you have a contract etc etc. you have to also explicitly state you have no intention of wanting to work or live in Australia, that you just want to visit recreationally as a tourist.
THIS IS WHY WE HAVE DIFFERENT STREAMS PEOPLE. why are you applying for a tourist visa and overstating your sisters illness?? CMON BRO WORK WITH ME HERE 🤣
Also as a very proud Australian, we are VERY proud of our rules and strict regulations. It’s what keeps our country fair, operational and free from corruption. Respect the rules and don’t whinge about them unnecessarily because you didn’t get what you wanted. Drop the entitlement, as I’ve stated prior, I’ve had friends be granted tourism visas (three years with unlimited entry) by doing the process correctly. Sometimes you do get an up the arse agent but As we Aussies say; ‘tough titties love’.
Hope this helped a little.
P.S: now I’m not generalising, but even with my husbands family, I’ve noticed that when it comes to beurocratic processes of other countries, it’s always ‘OH ITS CANADAS FAULT ITS A SHIT COUNTRY BLA VLA BLA’. When a quick google search will show you the clearly correct procedures to do something to avoid heart break.
Let’s not start criticising and making things like this about other shit just because you didn’t follow the rules properly. Also why the hell you booking flights and going to the airport without no damn visa? I apply for all my husbands visa (Indian passport) and we wait until we get that approval. That is what it is unfortunately and it is a hassle I understand. :(
In OP’s defence; there are NRI Indians who do have a stick up their arse in letting in fellow Indians. I’m diaspora Indian (born and raised in Sydney with parents who have been born and raised in a country outside of India for three generations but still Indian) and I’ve definitely worked with Indians who have just become citizens of are trying to. And my god do they act like they don’t know shit about India and do look down on them. Like for what? It’s so fucking embarrassing as an Indian diaspora kid who is proud of her roots. Their behaviour clearly panders to white supremacy here which is what the POC community is trying to ERADICATE.
And I’ll be so honest, with the cost of living and housing crisis in Sydney, I can bet you that the immigrant Indians I worked with at state level in the APS, they definitely would not be able to have the same level of savings of OP. And often these NRI folk get like envious and try to justify their move to Australia by putting down India, just to make themselves feel better about living in Sydney and trying to keep up with inflation and the cost of living crisis",2024-03-11T03:13:48.916Z,0.9966,negative,"visitor visa, indian immigrants, australian citizens"

There are two elements here. Firstly, whether your bachelors is itself a CRICOS registered course (i.e. can it be awarded independently of the Master). Secondly, whether the units you have completed so far would entitle you to be awarded the bachelor qualification.
i.e. if you dropped out of the Masters tomorrow, could you be awarded the bachelors, without having to re-enrolling and transfer credits?
The 485 visa requires you to meet the Australian Study Requirement, which in turn requires the applicant to have ""completed"" the ""degree"". The definition of both terms are found in legislation and crucial in terms of answering your question.

1d0c2dt,Do I fulfil Australian Study Requirements for Post-Study Work stream (Subclass 485)?,2024-05-25T13:29:16.538Z,"No problem at all.
The Australian Study Requirement for the Temporary Graduate visa (Subclass 485) – Post-Study Work Stream has specific conditions that must be met. Here are the key points relevant to your situation:
1. Two Academic Years (92 Weeks) Study Requirement:
• The Australian study requirement mandates that you must complete a course or courses that total at least two academic years (92 weeks) of study.
• This requirement is generally interpreted as needing to have been enrolled in the course(s) for a total of at least 92 weeks of actual academic study.
2. Overlap of Qualifications:
• If you complete more than one qualification and use only the most recent qualification to meet the Australian study requirement, any credit received in the most recent qualification from the previous qualification counts towards meeting the requirement.
• Additionally, the actual period of study within the previous qualification can also be used to meet the 16-month study requirement.
Given your scenario:
• You completed a Bachelor of IT and then enrolled in a Master of IT at the same university.
• Your Master’s program is reduced to 1.5 years (72 weeks) due to the 48 credit points you received from your Bachelor’s program.
• The total duration for the Master’s course (according to the CoE) is 16 months and 4 days.
Evaluating Your Eligibility:
1. Total Duration of Study:
• The Master’s program duration (16 months and 4 days as per your CoE) satisfies the 16-month requirement.
2. Two Academic Years (92 Weeks) Study:
• The 48 credit points from your Bachelor’s degree that reduced your Master’s study duration can be counted towards the 92-week requirement.
• To ensure you meet the 92 weeks requirement, the combined study period of your Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees should be considered.
Conclusion:
Based on your information:
• Your Master’s degree duration (including credit points from your Bachelor’s) effectively contributes towards the 92-week requirement.
• Your Statement of Completion indicates a total duration exceeding 16 months, which meets the required timeframe.
Given these factors, you likely meet the Australian Study Requirement for the Subclass 485 visa under the Post-Study Work Stream. However, visa applications can be complex, and interpretation of the requirements can vary. It would be prudent to consult with a registered migration agent or the Department of Home Affairs to confirm your eligibility and to ensure all documentation is correctly presented to support your case.",2024-05-25T16:50:20.637Z,0.9728,neutral,"fulfil australian study requirements, post study work stream subclass"

Not sure I would recommend it now? It would set any back 18 months from a career in the UK and from what I hear, sponsorships are as rare as hens teeth unless you have certain skills?

1dstmms,485 visa to 189 or 820? (Insight pls),2024-07-01T13:58:12.389Z,"But with current migration laws becoming strict and changing
This has always been one of my arguments for going with a Partner Visa despite the skilled visa's being cheaper and potentially take less time. You can't predict the future and you can't predict what sort of stunts the government is going to do next with temporary visa's.
With a Partner Visa you will get some more peace and can start thinking about saving up for a down deposit on a house. If your partner is earning more than you you might even be able to buy a house quicker than you think. After all the government is less likely to suddenly change the policy regarding Partner Visa's because it only makes up a very small amount of the immigration numbers.
I came to Australia in 2022 and applied for a Partner Visa in 2023. I still have about 6-8 months to wait until I can apply for the 801 partner visa (permanent) and then however long the grant takes which could be up to a year.

199xpof,Question about student visa (subclass 500) and temporary activity visa - student research stream (408),2024-01-18T18:58:50.290Z,"So while I'm not an expert on these student visa's I still like to comment to maybe help you in the right direction.
If you want to join your boyfriend on his student visa you will need to be added as a secondary applicant to a student visa application. The immi website says the following about bringing family like kids, spouse or partner:
You must declare your family members in your student visa application even if they do not plan to travel with you to Australia. If you do not do this, your family members will not be eligible for a student visa to join you in Australia.
Now in Australia you can only hold one visa at a time. If you hold a visa and you apply for another visa then the last granted visa will be the visa registered to you. The old visa will cease to exists.
From the immi website I would believe that if you are on your Temporary Activity visa and your boyfriend would apply for the student visa with you as the secondary applicant you can still do your research, go back to The Netherlands and later apply for the student visa / subsequent entrant visa to join your boyfriend back in Australia.
Altough I'm not quite sure if this is how it works if you're a secondary applicant or if you will get a similar visa to a student visa once your boyfriend gets his granted. Either way the student visa would have more rights than the temporary activity visa. I'd still recommend chatting with a migration agent about this, sometimes they offer free consultation, or at most you'll have to pay €100 or AUD 165 for some advice regarding this.
I hope this helps getting you in the right direction and good luck with your visa, study and PhD!",2024-01-19T04:49:12.806Z,0.9833,neutral,"student visa subclass, temporary activity visa student research stream"

Surely when they finish their course, they should return to their own country. If they really want to live and work in Australia, they can then apply for migrant entry, like anyone else. There qualifications and previous experience of Australia will stand them in good stead in their application. And anyone with a family member at university has heard many stories about how courses have been dumbed down, requirements loosened, and language standards go out the window, just to accommodate international students whose performance is below par, but whose dollars are indispensable. We are lowering quality by relying of international students.”
And this is really, really sad. Currently Australia operates on some bizarre scheme where many Chinese students come to Australia because they couldn't enroll in American or British university and their parents want to brag about their educated child and pass them their business once they got their degree from Western country. So they return to their country later and they hold really good degrees from Aussie universities but they don't plan to work in Australia or contribute to the country because the degree was just a pass to be a prospective and educated citizen back home. And then we have countries from East Asia like India where many come in to do VET courses just to stay, work 60 hours per week and send money back home whilst doing some bullshit courses in ghost colleges. And at the end we have local people who are trying to also study in American or British universities just to get out because cost of living here is so damn high and on the international scene Aussie universities are not that much respected when it comes to highly advanced subjects. Top educators and institutions know that Aussie universities often being used as second choice for those that couldn't enroll to US or UK. So we end up in a situation when we are having people hopping on visas and extending their stay artificially just to maybe get some luck and get invited for a 189 or 190 or nominated by employer and employers are craving for specialized employees. But those employees rather want to go to US where their salary is going to be much bigger. Those wanting to stay, finish degrees from business or currently even tech and they're having a hard time to find a job.

General public perceptions towards immigration isn't good and only getting worse, exacerbated by a housing crisis.
To achieve this, the high risk nationalities were always destined to cop the worst of it. They are more likely to want to stay after, they are more likely to bring family, and due to terrible wages/standards back home they are more likely to select easy, trivial courses to A) get in and B) be able to maximise working. Negative stereotypical connotations about these nationalities doing this means the change will likely be looked upon very favourably by and large.
Ironically despite a lot of back and forth arguments on the implications, the government could really win on all fronts on this. They are seen as taking decisive actions to reduce numbers and target fraudulent applications. Whilst unis are propped up largely on a lucrative international market, demand is so high at present, especially from the listed countries that they can really start cutting numbers and increasing rejections to whatever level they choose to balance keeping that international cash flow. Hopefully it can really start to weed out those fraudulent applications so the genuine students are arriving. One of the real travesties about visas is how a small minority of fraudulent applicants from these countries make it so much harder for their countrymen that are genuine.
Good on Germany for being proactive on filling their shortages (in theory no different to what the skilled visas are doing here). Not sure how quickly or effectively Indians will transition from speaking English, which is currently taught, to German. Or how long the good times there will last.

Does it matter which type of course? For example, could I pursue a certificate course or does it need to be a Bachelors/Masters?
It's fine as long as the course is registered on CRICOS but the visa duration will be set in line with the course, usually 1 month longer than your COE to give you time to pack up and leave after you have finished your study. If you are studying a course that's not a Bachelor or higher, the Department of Home Affairs will also take into account the availability of such a course in your home country when deciding whether or not to grant you a visa, so for example if you're from the USA (for example) and applying for a student visa for a certificate of cookery or whatever, you will have some challenging questions posed to you about why you would want to spend an absolute fortune doing such a basic course in Australia when every community college in America could provide it to you for less.
If Im being completely honest, studying is secondary to the experience of living and working in Australia.
Study is the priority of a student visa. Coming to Australia on a student visa for the purpose of engaging in work is a breach of visa conditions and your visa will be refused or cancelled if the government gets even a whiff of what you are up to.
Enrolling in a research based Masters means you have no limit on your work rights, but other student visa holders are capped at 48 hours per fortnight which you may recognise is absolutely nothing and will probably not be enough to support yourself long term, which is why student visa applications need you to demonstrate you can already financially support yourself before you arrive.
Look into the subclass 189, subclass 190 and subclass 491 instead. These are work visas that do not require employer sponsorship (you are nominated and invited to apply by Australia's federal government or one of our state governments).",2023-03-25T02:49:23.917Z,0.8475,neutral,"student visa, affordable programs"

China initially announced the visa-free policy for a trial period until November 30 this year, but has now extended it until December 31, 2025.
With the recent additions of Australia and New Zealand, the number of nations enjoying visa-free entry to China now totals 14. Passport holders from these countries can stay in China for up to 15 days for tourism, business, family visits, or transit purposes.
China also signed a 30-day mutual visa exemption agreement with Singapore and a similar arrangement with Thailand, effective March 1, allowing visa-free visits of up to 30 days per entry. It has also eased visa requirements for U.S. citizens visiting the country on tourist visas, removing the need to provide proof of round-trip air tickets, hotel reservations, itineraries, or invitation letters.
The Chinese government has also relaxed entry regulations for tourists arriving via cruise ships. As of May 15, such visitors can stay in China visa-free for up to 15 days.",2024-06-17T11:41:19.027Z,0.9705,neutral,free visa waiver program

Makes it sound like policy has changed due to a rational appraisal of actual outcomes versus intentions (probably a rarity):
“When Australia introduced the Business Innovation and Investment Program (BIIP) in 2012, the hope was that wealthy business owners, investors, and entrepreneurs would boost the economy by bringing in capital and driving innovation.
The results, though, have been underwhelming. A government review published in March found BIIP migrants contributed less to the economy than the average Australian, as the cohort, despite their wealth, tended to be older and earned lower incomes through capital returns on passive investments.”",2023-06-16T09:08:00.747Z,0.895,neutral,australia visa overhaul leaves chinese millionaires

Even just testing is more effective. I don't agree with testing and quarantine, but I would rather be offered this as an option as opposed to being forced to be vaccinated, (c) attempting to stop the spread of Covid is futile anyway, and indeed Australia's policies have completely failed.
All of the commentary and reporting that I have seen has treated the Australian vaccination and border regulations as if they are some unavoidable phenomenon of nature, akin to the sun rising in the morning and the tide rushing in to shore.
I already knew that the media was pathetic and supine before this issue arose, and I also realised that the general public was largely complacent and stupid. However, I truly didn't realise how bad the situation was. I thought that some people working in the media would be capable of some minor examples of critical thinking, but this seems to be completely beyond them. Either that, or they're willing to write and say things that they don't believe in, even when it is completely destroying our society and culture.
For me, things can never go back to normal. I will never wish to participate in society again, as I've seen it laid bare, and now know what the people who make it up are actually like.",2022-01-16T11:22:03.683Z,-0.974,negative,"novak djokovic tennis star, australia visa appeal"

And basically none of his fellow professionals have stood up or spoken out against this, even though the precedent and implications are far reaching. Their very entry to countries for participation at major events becomes subject to the whims of that country's government, conditional on them not just taking stipulated medical procedures, but also to them not rocking the boat and upsetting the regime.

Unemployment is 100% an issue.

You can ask your parents for a letter saying that they'll support you financially if you get in trouble, and expect you to return by a given date.
That all said, since you're from Latvia, you should be eligible for their eVisitor program, which has higher grant rates than regular visas.

1do2979,Australia Announces Work and Holiday Visa (Subclass 462) Eligibility and Opening Date for Filipinos,2024-06-25T09:55:10.437Z,"Differences to NZ WHV (from what I read so far):
Documents must be attached to the form before submission and payment (NZ: the application form must be submitted, and the application fee must be paid before submitting evidence).
An application cannot be submitted without the required uploads (NZ: no need to upload anything). There are 200 places instead of 100. Australia has a page where you can see all the country caps, and it gets updated from time to time (NZ: you need to check the per-country page).
Australia pauses intake if the country cap is close to being filled, if there's a high volume of applications, or if other reasons mean the program cannot be opened. It advises checking the status page occasionally (NZ: It is unknown if NZ does the same; they may not announce it).
Country caps open simultaneously at the start of the financial year (NZ: Different dates for different countries).
The minimum health and character requirements appear to be more stringent (NZ: full medical is optional or required only if declaring major illnesses; a PCC is not required since it's only a one-year visa unless character issues are declared).
There appear to be more options for meeting the functional English requirement (NZ: English test, CEMI from college/uni).
Shorter study duration allowed (NZ: 6 months).
Education requirements appear to be lower (NZ: Must be least a 3-year post-secondary program).
A more expensive application fee (NZ: 455 or Php 16,400).
Biometrics may be required. The Philippines is included in Australia's biometrics program. (NZ: no biometrics required).
Onshore applications are not allowed—if you are in Australia on a different visa (except very limited visa types) during processing, the visa can't be issued while onshore (NZ: both allowed for PHWHV).
Longer time with an employer (NZ: 3 months).
Eligibility for second and third 462 visas is 12 months each if the requirements are met (NZ: 3 months only).
More expensive in every aspect :)) (NZ: cheaper).
There does not seem to be a ""race"" in the sense that you can't just speed through the application form if you don't have everything yet, but it could be a race if everyone has everything ready already (NZ: a ""race"").
Medical insurance is suggested, but it is not a requirement.
Similarities:
Some countries fill their quotas quickly even within days of opening. (Aus: Start of financial year, NZ: Specific opening date per country)
There is an age limit of 18-30 years old.
Longer stays may be possible if you work in specific industries. Aus | NZ
Health tests may be completed before applying but don't guarantee approval.
Multiple entries are allowed.
12 consecutive months stay, time spent outside the country isn't added back.
One year to enter the country from approval.
Dependent children are not allowed.
Family members cannot be included in the application.
It is a legal requirement, to be honest and not submit fake documents or misleading information.
FYIs:
If you have used ImmiAccount before, you may know you cannot delete documents once they are uploaded. Please exercise caution when uploading your documents.
You will need a HAP ID to undergo the health tests. This is usually found within the referral letter sent to you, notifying you of the health checks you must do after applying for the visa. The step-by-step page on the Australian immigration website, however, mentions organising health checks before filling out a form. Ensuring that you take the right tests may be confusing, especially for someone unfamiliar with Australian immigration regulations. If you decide to do the health checks before applying, please get the correct advice for your circumstances from a registered migration agent or immigration lawyer.
There will be system maintenance of Aus immigration systems from 2 PM AEST on 30 June 2024 until 9 AM AEST on 1 July 2024.
Please create your ImmiAccount as soon as possible! 😊

I have been going to Australia every 3-5 years since I was a kid because I have family there and never had issues. I had friends submit their application later than mine and got theirs approved.Then covid happened anyway. Good thing MAS refunded my ticket due to covid.
2 years later (2022) they sent me a reason for rejection saying they closed their borders due to covid. But I know that's not true because they were still approving visas after my first submission.

If you have any meaningful skills or have some sort of technical diploma you might try your luck finding some kind of a job in a Northern Italian city. Given your age, I would suggest Bologna, it's a university city with many students and young people. Keep in mind that the job market isn't as dynamic as there, in Italy but in Europe overall, better employee rights makes it harder to have a job market comparable to yours or the American one where you can lose the job one day and the next you might already have found something comparable. I don't know how to explain it but there's less turnover and the hiring process is not as easy as there (because once the employer hires you legally it's very difficult for him to fire you, so it's kind of like that, you know...employer trying to find the best person he can knowing that later for him getting rid of you isn't easy)",2024-06-24T16:35:28.483Z,0.8857,neutral,work visa australia

If you have a look at p27 of the report you'll see the estimate is the average parent visa holder will consume between $335k and $410k in lifetime costs (that is subsidies from services like Medicare etc) - again, these are persons who have likely never paid into the system through taxes.
Under that model, it costs Australia ~$270k - $360k for every parent who is granted a contributory parent visa.

In Australia, we would call this sort of placement a “medical elective” if done as part of your medical course for University.

.....The increase is part of the government's move to curb net migration which rose to a record 528,000 people in 2022-2023 after COVID restrictions were removed.
Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said the changes will create ""a migration system which is fairer, smaller and better able to deliver for Australia,"" in a statement.

Trains are being the worst at the moment so if you can minimize commuting to work, that would be ideal.
Also, majority of apartments are not insulated. I grew up in Montreal....I was cold in winter here. Because you are never warm Edit: I don't spell check",2022-03-18T03:12:39.063Z,0.7813,neutral,holiday visa

196yyhu,Current trend of getting working holiday visa in Australia,2024-01-15T03:40:38.871Z,"So... I'm Australian and have a lot of friends who are currently on or were on WHV. Most of these friends arrived pre-covid and are only just finishing their 4 or 5 years on WHV/Covid visas etc. These people had the best experience because they were able to stay and work for more than the normal 3 years (due to covid visas), they had no competition for jobs (WHV holders left australia during covid, so people who stayed were able to get better jobs) and they were able to access a range of government free money (eg relocation assistance, money to take a covid test).
It is more difficult now for Indonesians to get the best jobs in Australia when on WHV and in my experience this is because they aim too low compared to other nationalities. Many Koreans who arrive have a very solid plan in place to take the best jobs (like operating a forklift) whereas many Indonesians just try and get any job they can to fill their bank accounts. That's OK, but you always need to be trying to get a better job in a better industry.
I think WHV is the best opportunity for many young Indonesians to save money. It is realistic to save 600jt+ in one year. Even more if you have a friend to share costs with and you can keep working all through the year.
Many Indonesian friends of mine don't want to return to Indonesia after working in Australia because they can't see themselves ever working for UMR in Indonesia again. Most of them try and use the money they saved doing WHV to search for a pathway to PR (usually via study, sometimes by marrying an Australian).
As a general rule, the best jobs for WHV workers are in cotton gin, winery, almonds harvest, rice harvest, grain harvest, solar farm. These jobs are very competitive and it's difficult to get one if you don't have any experience. You will usually start in the harder jobs like picking blueberries or mangoes and if you manage to get a job on a farm driving a machine (loader, forklift, tractor), you have a better chance of getting one of the good jobs in cotton, grain or winery.
One last recommendation. Go regional. Staying in the cities and working as a barista can be a nice lifestyle, but you won't save any money. You need to go regional and stay there. It's where the money is, following the seasons. Oh, and never work for an Indonesian.

BRASILIA Brazil's government is considering waiving visas for visitors from the United States, Japan, Canada and Australia to boost tourism, and could eventually extend the plan to include China, a tourism ministry spokesman said on Monday.
The minister's proposal still needs approval by other departments of the Brazilian government, particularly the foreign ministry which issues the visas and has demanded reciprocity to exempt U.S. citizens from needing visas.
Visitors from most Latin American and European Union nations, and Russia, do not need visas to travel to Brazil, but U.S. travelers have to cough up $160 for a visa to visit Brazil, an identical fee charged to Brazilians for visas to visit the United States.

Legally, the 651 visa requires you to be a ""genuine temporary entrant"" (GTE). There is no fixed legal definition of what this means, and in reality, that gives DHA decision-makers and border officers a degree of freedom to exercise their subjective judgement.
The most common way in which the ""frowned upon"" element is manifested is when you're re-entering the country, where border agents may question you about your intentions (we've all seen the show Border Security).
The more serious way you could run afoul of the law would be a notice of intention to consider cancellation, however this is usually rare unless you are exiting and re-entering in a really obvious way to subvert the GTE requirement over multiple occasions.
Neither of these appear to have happened to you. As long as things stay that way, you are unlikely to see any consequences of being ""frowned upon"" by the Department.
Will you run into trouble if you keep exiting and re-entering several times a year, and keep reapplying for 651s year after year to maintain de facto residence? Yes, absolutely. Will it happen with your current movement history? Unlikely.
Hopefully it is clear that both ends of the opinion spectrum that people have mentioned are correct - this is not a simple black & white issue.
In terms of its impact on your partner visa application - as long as your 651 is not subject to enforcement action, you should not have any issues making a partner visa application. The main focus is whether you meet the eligibility criteria of the partner visa itself - which is dependent on your personal circumstances and a different topic of discussion.
Hope that helps.

We're looking at around 120 visa types, a staggering bureaucracy, a million people waiting in the pipeline, and processing times that drag out for half a decade or more. Meanwhile, migrants are being cornered into sticking to one job and students are hitting rock-bottom trying to make ends meet with limited work hours. And let's not get started on the convoluted rules and costs involved in establishing relationships.
Why not ditch the whole administrative nightmare and bring economics into the game? We've all heard economists say that if demand greatly outstrips supply, then the price is too low. So why not apply that principle to visas? Imagine a ""visa rental"" system where we set the price such that the demand for visas equals the supply of visas (i.e., the number of people we're willing to let in). It would be a weekly rent and would add to government revenue.
This way, we're essentially ensuring that those who want to come in the most will be the ones coming in. By natural selection, job roles with a shortage would attract migrants, as these roles would offer higher pay than equivalent jobs overseas. This would also give local employees more bargaining power. And from the migrant's point of view, they'd have the freedom to change jobs once they're here without the fear of deportation looming over them.",2023-06-16T03:52:59.915Z,0.8955,neutral,australia visa overhaul leaves chinese millionaires

I got approval within 2 days when I applied in August 2022, and I was approved for my second year visa within 1 day this past September. When applying, make sure you get every document you possibly can to submit with the application. They also require proof of at least $5000AUD (around $3000USD last I checked, you can use a currency converter on google for the exact amount). I saved about $6000USD on top of ticket price, baggage checks, etc, and it was definitely a good amount to have for me. The ticket alone was around $1,400USD, but I also booked it only a week in advance.
Look at a few general areas, research hostels and other housing options in those areas, and make an estimated budget based on where you plan to stay, what kind of job you plan to get to support yourself while you're here, what activities you may be interested in, if any. As for where to go, I live in a town called Mackay, and if you like sun this is a good place. It's pretty, its peaceful, it feels like constant summer, and the people here have been very welcoming. Not too judgy, which I found a little surprising. I haven't been anywhere else yet, so I can't speak on other places.
It's not too hard of a process, just make sure you have the proper paperwork. There's an entire step by step list of what to do/have on the Australian immigration website, and they have estimated processing times on there as well. The link for the Work and Holiday Visa--> https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/work-holiday-462/first-work-holiday-462
I used a company called Visa First and they did the whole submission process for me the first time, cost about $500, I think, but their rates may be different now. Just had to send them copies of all my documents and they did the rest. If you submit yourself, the current price is $635AUD, which should be somewhere between $400-$500USD.
All in all, my planning took about 6 months, but that's just because I needed literally everything, including a passport, and I had to wait for it all to process. Plan according to what you need to wait for, if anything, and how long the estimated time is on the immigration website.

I'm Australian but I did the WHV thing with my girlfriend. These are a couple of things I'd suggest:
we always had a place to stay, but from what I've observed with other backpackers, finding affordable accommodation can be an absolute nightmare, especially in Melbourne and Sydney. Look into it before you come. You can find Facebook groups where people advertise rooms and also use Gumtree.
get a car or a van ASAP, preferably something you can sleep in. Unless you want to stay in a big city the whole time, you will need it to truly experience Australia.
if you want to find work for your visa extension, don't just stick around towns along the East Coast, whether that be NSW or Queensland, or in Melbourne because that's what most people do. We found work just by turning up to random pubs in inland Queensland and enquiring.
if you want accommodation as part of the deal with work, you may have some luck on dairy farms or in rural/remote pubs. Bear in mind that working on a dairy farm SUCKS.

Reasons they probably ask this question:
to see if you have stayed >1 year in a single country, which would mean you need a police certificate from there
to check ""red flags"" e.g. lots of travel to unusual/dangerous countries
to check if you left a country after you got a visa from there

Rant start:
Need that fucking visa ASAP before my Dad's health issues get serious. Plus I'm having to tolerate a shitty job because of these Home Affairs pricks. Despite being finally invited, I 110% regret trying to immigrate to Australia via student visa and ever since I came back I've been persuading people left, right and center not to immigrate to Australia via this shitshow student visa-focused 'points-based' system. Think I've saved the life and savings of so many younger fellows by sparing them this horseshit torture. FYI, I discourage all non-scholarship, full-fee paying third-world students now from migrating via student visa to US/UK/Australia/Canada because of how expensive the degrees are and how all 4 immigration systems of these countries suck.
Personally, I admit I spent too much money, delayed my personal and professional life too long for these cunts. 120% if given the opportunity to go back in time, I would go to a mainland European country on a student visa with lower tuition, learn the language if required, tolerate whatever weather is required and undergo a simple af immigration system which just requires you have a work-permit based job that is renewed every year instead of this sham of a 'points-based' system.

Nijisanji IN was definitely a swing and a miss and had such a rocky history when you consider their temporary re-branding to Niji EN then back to IN once they started to hold auditions for an actual EN branch.
I do feel bad for Noor, Aadya and Vihaan though as I feel they were severly limited by their hardware. I remember giving them a shot when I first heard of them, but both Aadya and Vihaan had very laggy streams (whether because of their hardware or internet, who can say) and even Noor, the most popular of the group, had pretty bad audio on her streams.
I kinda hope we do get to see them again in the future, especially since they all do speak English well enough, but I can imagine that this whole experience could have soured the vtuber experience for them.

It was graduation day, but the problem was I was deep into my playthrough of Zelda Breath of the Wild. I figured it'd be fine to just wrap it up during the ceremony, I mean surely everyone would understand the importance of Miyamoto's baby. How was I to face graduation and adulthood, if I did not help Link face Ganon first. So I was glued to the screen the entire time, not clapping once for my classmates. I had to stay focused. I popped at least 5 red bulls and 7 five hour energies to stay alert while fighting moblins and dodongoes. I even made sure to give out a loud Link grunt (Yes that's Link not Zelda) every time he did in the game. I thought that must've invigorated the other graduates, they must've been inspired. When my name was called, I was in the midst of the final battle and did not hear it. The vile bully behind me (must've been a Sony Pony) pushed my gaze away and nudged me to prematurely accept my diploma. I politely urged him in the name of Reggie to stop but he became more and more angry. Why? Did he not want Link to succeed and save both Hyrule and Zelda? In a final act of cruelty, he took my switch and smashed it on the ground. At first I looked in horror at what he did to my splatoon oled, and then it turned to rage. I snapped and immediately tackled the fiend to the ground. I believe Iwata from the Heavens gave me strength, and so I bit his ear off. Icky blood squirted everywhere, glad that's not in any Nintendo classics! Afterwards, instead of the expected praise from the crowd, some brutes pushed me to the ground and held me there.

xoew6n,What are your thoughts on migrating to Australia/Canada/Europe,2022-09-26T09:57:41.600Z,"Kuwait's good if you have a more conservative mindset, apart from the fact that naturalization is not a possibility.
Most expats I know have lived in Kuwait for long enough or more to have been eligible for citizenship in other countries, had they moved there instead. I also think it's important to consider that countries where you have to pay tax aren't the outliers, it's countries that are tax-free like Kuwait that are the outliers. If people all over the world manage to do it, it surely can't be that difficult to eventually get adjusted to.
I personally am not conservative and would prefer a more liberal lifestyle, one in which people are not looked at differently based on religion, nationality, and gender. I would also prefer the freedom to drink and eat what I feel like and even have other people eat and drink what they feel like even if it's not something that my beliefs agree with( (unless it's weird, like cannibalism or something). I'd willingly give up some of the comforts Kuwait has to offer in exchange for these benefits.
Pretty sure I'm going to get the ""Then why are you here?"" question at some point and the reason why I am is that Kuwait is simply the best option I have at the moment. I don't hate the country (it's given me a lot for which I'm grateful) but I can't say it's somewhere I'd see myself living for much longer due to the reasons stated above.",2022-09-26T12:44:41.404Z,0.9676,neutral,australia canada europe

14tiyal,Dutch government collapses over immigration policy,2023-07-07T20:47:57.549Z,"[Dutch government collapses over immigration policy](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte speaks at a news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron (not pictured) during Macron's state visit to the Netherlands, in Amsterdam, Netherlands April 12, 2023. REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw/File Photo)
AMSTERDAM, July 7 (Reuters) - The Dutch government on Friday collapsed after failing to reach a deal on restricting immigration, junior coalition partner Christian Union said, a move expected to trigger new elections in the fall.
""The four parties decided that they cannot reach an agreement on migration. Therefore they decided to end this government,"" party spokesman Tim Kuijsten said, confirming media reports that Prime Minister Mark Rutte would tender the resignation of his government.
The crisis was triggered by a push by Rutte's conservative VVD party to limit the flow of asylum seekers to the Netherlands, which split his four-party government coalition when two parties refused to support his proposals.
Tensions came to a head this week, when Rutte demanded support for a proposal to limit entrance for children of war refugees who are already in the Netherlands and to make families wait at least two years before they can be united.
This last proposal went too far for the small Christian Union and liberal D66, triggering a crisis.
""It's a sad day,"" Defence Minister Kajsa Ollongren said as she arrived for an emergency cabinet meeting called after the migration talks ended in a stalemate.
""We have talked for a long time, but we have failed to reach agreement.""
Rutte will hold a press conference after the cabinet meeting, his office said.
The Netherlands already has a one of Europe's toughest immigration policies but under the pressure of right-wing parties, Rutte had for months been trying to seek ways to further reduce the inflow of asylum seekers.
Asylum applications in the Netherlands jumped by a third last year to over 46,000, and the government has projected they could increase to more than 70,000 this year - topping the previous high of 2015.
This will again put a strain on the country's asylum facilities, where for months last year hundreds of refugees at a time were forced to sleep in the rough with little or no access to drinking water, sanitary facilities or health care.
Rutte last year said he felt ""ashamed"" of the problems, after humanitarian group Medecins sans Frontieres sent in a team to the Netherlands for the first time ever, to assist with migrants' medical needs at the centre for processing asylum requests.
He promised to improve conditions at the facilities, mainly by reducing the number of refugees that reach the Netherlands. But he failed to win the backing of coalition partners who felt his policies went too far.
Rutte, 56, is the longest-serving government leader in Dutch history and the most senior in the EU after Hungary's Viktor Orban. He is expected to lead his VVD party again at the next elections.
Rutte's current coalition, which came to power in January 2022, was his fourth consecutive administration since he became prime minister in October 2010.

1dtpz7b,New Dutch PM vows to carry out 'strictest-ever' immigration policy,2024-07-02T16:24:52.751Z,"From The Telegraph's Europe Editor, James Crisp:
The Dutch king has sworn in former spy chief Dick Schoof as prime minister of a government promising to deliver the Netherlands’ “strictest-ever” immigration policy.
Mr Schoof takes over from Mark Rutte, the longest-serving prime minister in Dutch history, 223 days after Geert Wilders won a shock victory in an election that stunned Europe.
He presented his ministers in the Right-wing coalition to Willem-Alexander in the ornate “Oranjezaal” in the royal palace, with them each stepping forward to swear allegiance to the king and the constitution.
Mr Wilders, the populist firebrand leader of the Freedom Party (PVV), was forced to shelve his ambitions to become prime minister to keep coalition talks on track.
There were fears his campaign promises to ban the Koran and hold a Nexit referendum on Dutch EU membership were too extreme.
Instead, the four coalition partners agreed their leaders would not be in government before compromising on Mr Schoof, 67, who previously ran the Dutch secret service.
Mr Wilders, who campaigned for “zero asylum seekers”, secured backing for a crackdown on asylum and migration from the pro-business VVD party, radical centrist NSC and farmers’ party the BBB.
The coalition has pledged a two-year asylum crisis act to drive down numbers arriving in the Netherlands and to demand an opt-out from EU asylum rules, which will put the new government on a collision course with Brussels.
It plans a maximum reduction in migrant numbers without giving a hard figure. The agreement includes austere reception centres, a hold on processing asylum applications and only temporary asylum being granted.
The 26-page coalition agreement, titled Hope, courage and pride, also calls for considering the idea of moving the Dutch embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
Seven youth branches of Dutch political parties, including the VVD and NSC, called on the new government to reconsider the asylum plans on Tuesday.
They said that the asylum crisis was actually a reception crisis caused by a staffing and housing shortage that left asylum centres overcrowded.
Amnesty International held a protest outside the royal palace as the ministers were sworn in.

In terms of Asylum seekers, we have deterred the country shoppers and now are only taking refugees directly from the camps. This prevents drownings, economic refugees and removes money as the difference between languishing in a refugee camp for 20 years and paying a people smuggler for entry.
In terms of the global issue of refugees, resettlement is never a viable option for solving it when there are 60 million worldwide. Especially considering the population of Africa is going to grow by over a billion in 30 years whilst the tax payers in the West are stable or shrinking.
Germany has taken in over a million in a single year and the worldwide number of refugees still went up.

But there is no such queue, because countries are not obliged to take in refugees assigned for resettlement by the UN; if they do, it is purely good will. Signatories to the UN refugee convention are, however, obliged to assess the claims of asylum seekers reaching their shores. Australia is a society obsessed with rules and fairness, and the queue-jumping argument resonates perfectly with a population primed to think in terms of orderly regulations, most of whom have never faced state-sponsored violence or war crimes. By this logic, whether or not you have had your hand chopped off doesn’t matter if you broke the “rules” to get to Australia.
The problem is, however, is that if we accept there is no ""queue,"" then the public will indefinitely support the boat policy, because the alternative is a free-for-all in which we accept any of the 50 million asylum seekers in the world today (excluding all those who would try and make the journey if we did).",2017-10-12T08:35:30.707Z,0.9018,neutral,australia immigration policy

Without water you die quickly. Go into the Australian desert unprepared and you can be dead in hours.
Australia doesn't have a lot of freshwater. Even the big cities in the temperate/sub-tropical regions like Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth have desalination plants. These cities are in ""green"" areas. The only places with abundant freshwater are north east Queensland (tropical seaside areas with a nice mountain range to dam) and the monsoon areas in the northern territory and far north of WA (Lake Argyle, The Kakadu).
North Queensland is decently settled, but suffers from Tropical Cyclones. It's also full of scary shit like Coastal Taipains, Cassowarys, crocodiles and the worst of all, rural Queenslanders.
Northern Territory and the areas around Kununurra in northern Western Australia are similarly full of scary things and cyclones plus you get the monsoon which means months of challenges moving around. Plus there are two seasons in that area: Fucking hot and dry and fucking hot and wet. Oh, and the tidal range is 7 metres (23 feet in freedumb units).
I am not saying you can't live in these areas, indigenous peoples did for millennia. That being said, there were still more of them on the coast than the desert.
In Western Australia, we built a dam on the Ord river for the purpose of agriculture and development, this reservoir became Lake Argyle. Second largest freshwater reservoir on the continent. It's huge (and yes, there are freshwater crocodiles in it). It spawned a town to service the dam and the agriculture to follow.
The town is called Kununurra and has a population of 5,300. Mean minimum temperature is 21c (71F) and mean high is 35c (95f) maximum high is 45c (111f). It's 3,000 km from the state capital Perth. It's 800km from Darwin. Unsurprisingly, if you grow up there and don't want to be a farmer or related you leave and don't come back.
Back in the mid 2010s the government formed an infrastructure fund to try and get development moving in these areas. Put $5 billion AUD into the fund. Four fifths of fuck all happened with the money (it didn't help that the government was dumb as fuck conservatives who blocked any renewables development with this money).
TLDR huge distances, lack of water, geography, weather and opportunity are all factors into why it's tough to live here outside the established cities.",2022-11-19T12:21:52.526Z,-0.9863,negative,"australia population, uninhibitle land, generous immigration attitude, child limit"

Former President Donald J. Trump is claiming that nine documents seized by the F.B.I. from his Florida residence are his personal property — but the Justice Department says they are official records that should be deposited with the National Archives, according to a new letter to the special master who is overseeing a review of the materials.
The letter, filed on Thursday by the Justice Department, describes disputes over ownership and executive privilege claims involving a batch of 15 records that have undergone early review. It likely foreshadows larger fights to come over the main bulk of roughly 13,000 documents and other materials F.B.I. agents took from Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s club and residence, in a court-authorized search in August.
The materials from the initial tranche that Mr. Trump maintains belong to him include six packages submitted to him when he was president supporting requests that he grant clemency to pardon-seekers; two documents related to his administration’s immigration policies; and an email addressed to him from a person at a military academy, it said.
But the Justice Department, in its letter, scoffed at the notion that any of those materials belong to Mr. Trump. It cited the Presidential Records Act, which says all documentary materials created or received by a president, his staff or his office in the course of official activities are government property that should go to the National Archives when a president leaves office.
Of the pardon packages, for example, the Justice Department wrote: “Those requests were received by plaintiff in his capacity as the official with authority to grant reprieves and pardons, not in his personal capacity.”
The dispute stems from a decision by Judge Aileen M. Cannon in Florida’s Southern District to grant Mr. Trump’s request that she intervene in the Justice Department’s inquiry into whether he had unlawfully kept classified records at his estate and obstructed the government’s repeated efforts to retrieve them.",2022-10-21T14:18:52.265Z,0.9925,neutral,"trump claims, white house pardon, immigration policy records"

It serves the corporatist overlords that actually run our country. It floods our labor market. That in turns drives down the price of labor and creates armies of desperate people that are willing to work three shitty, minimum wage jobs just to get by.

I have no problem with the number of immigrants coming into the United States
You might reconsider that. It's one of the reasons our floor remains so low while cost of living keeps rising. It's a matter of supply and demand. When you have 100 jobs for 80 people, wages rise. When you have 100 jobs for 120 people, wages drop. Same goes with housing, same goes with everything people need. Prices rise as demand does.
We don't need to stop immigration, but we definitely need to keep it at a level that we can handle. If our population had grown by 20% instead of 50% over the last 50 years wages would be higher and housing prices would be lower. We'd be much better able to provide both for current citizens and those coming to join our nation if we kept the influx at a slower pace.",2023-09-22T15:59:08.126Z,0.8081,neutral,"immigration policy, total shitshow"

Lots of other culture war issues have proven salient with the hardest core of the Republican base, but the iffy moderate just is not really all that motivated by those issues. Immigration is the only one that has reliably stuck, and Republicans have been harping on it since the 80s.
Democrats have, on multiple occasions, attempted to reach across the aisle to fix the problem and create an orderly, legal pathway to citizenship. Republicans have rebuffed them. Many of these proposals have gotten broad bipartisan support until the political spin doctors realized that their golden issue was about to be swiped out from under their noses.
Republican approaches to the border are largely theatrical productions. The Trump wall is a big, flashy object that has not, will not, and would not do much to actually curb illegal immigration. Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott shuffling migrants around the nation hasn't done much to help solve the problem. Republicans love to complain and complain about the issue, but never propose any actual solutions. There's a good reason for this - if the issue were solved, they'd be out of office. Their other policies are wildly unpopular, especially in the era of Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Paul Gosar, and Lauren Boebert essentially holding the House of Representatives hostage.
The reasons for the current migrant surge are pretty obvious, and have little to do with any US policy:
Unrest and upheavals in South American and Central American countries
Global warming causing warmer parts of the world (South and Central America) to have lower crop yields
Unrealized demand that was tamped down during COVID
None of these have much to do with US policy. We can't control the supply of people seeking to cross the border.
Finally, while you say that you love immigration, implicit in your post is the notion that illegal immigration is bad. However, the economists that birthed the Republican approach to immigration believed that immigration was good so long as it was illegal. Source.
Why is it that Trump rails against immigrants? It gets him votes. Why is it that Republicans block legal pathways to immigration? Because they want it to remain illegal. Why is it that we are constantly hearing about ""chaos at the border""?

Perhaps first go and ask the Chinese how that worked out for them.
Spoiler alert:
Mongol Invasions (13th Century): The Mongol Empire, under the leadership of Genghis Khan, successfully breached the Great Wall and invaded China in the early 13th century. The most famous breach occurred in 1211 when the Mongols, after a protracted siege, captured the Jin Dynasty's strategic stronghold of Yehuling.
Jurchen Jin Dynasty: Prior to establishing the Yuan Dynasty, the Mongols, under the leadership of Genghis Khan, and later his successors, broke through the Great Wall to invade the Jin Dynasty, which controlled northern China. The capture of key fortresses like Yehuling and the surrender of the Jin capital Zhongdu (modern-day Beijing) were pivotal events.
Manchu Invasion (17th Century): The Manchu, who established the Qing Dynasty, successfully breached the Great Wall at Shanhaiguan in 1644, leading to the fall of the Ming Dynasty. This event is known as the Battle of Shanhaiguan.
Dzungar Invasions (18th Century): The Dzungar Khanate, a nomadic confederation in Central Asia, invaded China several times in the 18th century, bypassing the Great Wall through less fortified areas in the northwest.
Japanese Invasions (20th Century): During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), Japan invaded China and captured significant portions of territory, including Beijing and other regions near the Great Wall. The wall was not a substantial obstacle for modern military forces.
Mongolian Incursions (20th Century): In the mid-20th century, there were several border skirmishes between China and the Mongolian People's Republic, which eventually led to border agreements and the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Mongolia.",2023-09-22T12:37:26.976Z,0.9905,neutral,"immigration policy, total shitshow"

Extract from a letter to the editor in the Melbourne Age the other week -
...The Australian economy cannot return to the past unsustainable ponzi scheme of pouring in more and more immigrants as a lazy way to maintain positive growth. Our major cities are full and under infrastructure and environmental stress. Pouring in more migrants to the levels of the past will just exacerbate the situation and negatively impact the already strained liveability . The solution needs to be a mixture of development of local skills and a temepered immigration program to fill the genuine gaps.
Comments from Bob Carr in 2017
..Carr says that by the early 2000s the NSW government was spending about double what it had been in the 1990s on infrastructure and still struggling to keep up with increasing demands.
He dismissed the argument that the population growth could be accommodated with better planning. “Any idiot can say ‘it’s just a matter of infrastructure’, as though nobody had thought of that before.
“Every suburb of Sydney, except those with political protection like Point Piper and Ku-ring-gai, is being transformed.”
Carr also challenges the argument that high immigration benefited the nation by sustaining growth. “It is a pretty lazy growth model. It is as if we have given up any innovation for an economy based on throwing up apartment blocks and shopping malls.”
He believes high immigration is being sustained politically due to the disconnect between those who benefit and those who pay – federal governments benefit from economic growth immigration spurs, while a handful of state governments foot the bill.
“It is effectively a Canberra conspiracy against the rest of the nation…
Carr does not believe that new immigrants can be encouraged to spread across the nation either, in part because unlike the United States it does not have a vast inland river system. Population, he says, will continue to gravitate to the south-east, which will soon attain levels of density “you can’t even imagine”.",2022-09-02T01:36:13.075Z,0.9843,neutral,"albanese government, permanent migration"

I was at the protest and we scheduled the streets to be blocked off and went the proper and legal route for our march. At that point the arrests did not occur. The arrests were deliberately caused by locking arms and disrupting the parade. Through this act we hoped to gain more visibility. When the police escorted the protesters out of the way of the parade, they peacefully followed the officers and were arrested off to the side of the parade.
If anyone’s been to a Philly parade they know that pedestrians are allowed to and do cross in the middle constantly. In our case we sat it out and stayed a bit longer for visibility. We just want to make the atrocities going on more visible and pass on our message as Jews and supporters that we will not silently let concentration camps exist.
Thank you for reading and helping spread the message!

mfq5q1,[Guide] 2021 Update for Aus by Migration Agent/Former Immigration Officer,2021-03-29T13:59:33.052Z,"THANK YOU so much for this post! I love your posts, I remember the last one being super helpful and loved the way you laid out all the info in this one! I have a few questions if that would be okay!
I am a Canadian-American international student who was in Australia when covid hit. I finished my undergrad degree overseas. I decided I also want to do my postgrad overseas and immigrate to Australia permanently.
Thus, I have just enrolled in a Doctor of Physiotherapy course in Australia, which was going to commence this July, 2021. I was supposed to be onshore by this July to start my new course, however, due to the course’s clinical hands-on nature, the uni won’t let us complete any part of the course online (and rightfully so). So, my uni postponed my course start date until July 2022, thus I won’t graduate until 2025. It was sad realizing I won’t be back this year, but I know I will make the best out of a gap year!
Do you think that vaccinated international students will be allowed into Australia by July 2022?
Physiotherapists are currently on the skilled shortage workers visa list. Do you think that physiotherapist will be a career on that list for a while? Say, 2025-2026 when it would be my time to apply for the skilled shortage visa after doing a year on a post-grad visa? I assume yes, due to the aging population. However, I know things change all the time.
I’m not sure if you could answer any of these questions since the future is so unknown, especially now, however I know you are an immigration expert and thought maybe you would know a few things, given the past patterns of the skilled shortage workers list, and any recent news about students’ return. I would greatly appreciate any insight, as if I can’t get back to Australia by 2022, I may start looking into other countries/unis so that I can become a physiotherapist before my undergraduate pre-requisite units expire (like anatomy, biomechanics, physiology, statistics etc.). I would not want to have to redo my undergrad, haha!",2021-03-29T21:28:06.239Z,0.9741,neutral,"migration agent, immigration officer"
mfq5q1,[Guide] 2021 Update for Aus by Migration Agent/Former Immigration Officer,2021-03-29T13:59:33.052Z,"Hi! I'm in the UK and currently have a job offer from a company in Sydney for a software engineering role.
They want to bring me (and my partner) over on a 482 visa once the travel situation gets better - I understand travel exemptions are possible for software engineers as that is an occupation on the PMSOL list, but apparently flight ticket prices etc. are still prohibitively steep...
Let's say I get the 482 visa for 2 years and then want to apply for PR. From what I understand the 190 skilled regional-nominated visa is probably the best bet. However, I have a feeling the points requirement would still be pretty high for NSW (thanks to Sydney)...is that something you can confirm?
As an aside, any idea regarding processing times for 482 visas for people on the PMSOL list atm? For the medium term stream, the IMMI website says 75% hear back within 5 months...is that accurate in your experience?

I'm a UK citizen, partner Australian, she's been back in NSW since March 2020 after her UK visa expired. The plan was for me to move to Sydney a few months later (probably on sponsored work visa, but didn't figure out exact details, the world felt more care-free back then) but then COVID hit and now we've been apart for a year. Currently thinking Working Holiday Visa (or Tourist visa) -> 820 -> 801 is probably the route for us. Does the fact that I've been on a 457 before affect this? How do you think the fact that we've been physically apart for over a year now will affect our defacto status?

It brings together a high-level analysis of what my partner and I have been trying to navigate for the past month or so! I had a couple of questions I’d be grateful for your advice on:
I watched the YouTube video you linked in your post which seems to suggest the best route to PR currently is finding a university course to study an occupation that doesn’t require work experience, in the state you’d like to live in. Have I understood that correctly? If so, I’m considering studying midwifery over there as I know nurses are needed but the fees look extortionate. Does the gov offer any support or grants for international students wanting to study a much needed occupation? For info we’d be looking to move to Sydney.
Secondly, my partner is an electronics engineer with a masters degree and 2 years experience. We’ve been told by an immigration agent that the 190 visa is our best bet to move over there, and electronics engineer looks to be on the MLTSSL. However, I’m having trouble getting my head around the state sponsorship aspect. How are 190 visas more likely to be granted than 189? Does the state have access to the skill select database/EOIs and dip in when there’s a particular shortage? And would those with 90+ points not always still get priority, like with the 189?
For info, we’ve already used up our working holiday visas living out there in 2018. I’d be grateful for any insight! Many thanks in advance!",2021-03-30T15:56:46.097Z,0.9863,neutral,"migration agent, immigration officer"

As tensions have erupted at college campuses throughout the country after Hamas’s attack on Israel, former president Donald Trump and other Republican presidential candidates have called to revoke student visas and deport foreign nationals who express support for Palestinians or criticize Israel’s military response — moves that would amount to violations of their First Amendment rights, according to some legal experts.
Student protests have ranged from urging a cease-fire or denouncing the treatment and killing of Palestinian civilians to blaming Israel for Hamas’s attack, a position that has been criticized across the political spectrum. Some Republican candidates have not differentiated the protests in their comments, generalizing protest participants as supporting Hamas.Trump, the dominant polling leader in the GOP race, said this week that if he is returned to the White House, his administration would revoke student visas of “radical, anti-American and antisemitic foreigners.”
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) also expressed support for deporting international students who he deems supportive of Hamas, saying, “You don’t have a right to be here on a visa. You don’t have a right to be studying in the United States.”
In a radio interview the same day, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said of student protests: “If any of those students on college campuses are foreign nationals on a visa, they should be sent back to their country.”
The proposals reflect the determination by much of the GOP field to stake out increasingly hard-line stances against many Muslim immigrants and in support of Israel, with candidates saying the United States should not accept any refugees from Gaza — where Israel has cut off electricity, food and fuel in response to Hamas’s deadly attack.
The scrutiny on students and their response to the war triggered by Hamas’s strike also reflects the inclination by many Republicans to direct criticism toward universities and campus communities they have frequently clashed with on cultural issues.
Many Republicans have positioned themselves as stalwart defenders of free speech, often alleging that conservative views are muted at colleges and universities. Republicans’ posture on student protesters conflicts with that stance, some immigration and civil rights advocates said. Those advocates also cautioned that such proposals dangerously conflate protesters who criticize Israel’s response to Hamas’s attack or voice concern for Palestinians with those supporting Hamas — the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip.
“The First Amendment protects the right to speak of all people who live in this country, whether they’re here as citizens, whether they’re here as foreign nationals, whether they’re students, whether they’re visitors,” said David Cole, the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union and a law professor at Georgetown University. “The First Amendment prohibits the government from punishing someone for their speech or their association. And so I think they’re nonstarters.”
The Trump, DeSantis and Scott campaigns did not respond to questions seeking more detailed explanations of how to reconcile the proposals with the Constitution’s protection of free speech or how they would determine which students they classify as anti-Israel or pro-Hamas.

Immigration was sold to Canadians as helping improve affordability of life and quality of life as it would help fund social programs. It has put us in one of the deepest housing crisis we have ever known in this nation alongside a general affordability of life/quality of life crisis. How does this help our seniors and other vulnerable communities survive?
It doesn't. It took alienated and struggling demographics and completely divorced them from the system. Now we have record high food bank usage, shelters are full, and tent slums continue to grow every fucking month. Every single story now in Canada is about how hard it is to simply survive. If you don't come from generational wealth or have a safety housing net it is impacting peoples mental health to the point of break downs. We have rising rates of depression and anxiety year after year. Substance abuse keeps going up. These are not the signs of a mentally healthy society.
This doesn't even mention the ethnic, religious, and political conflicts we have imported to our streets.
My god have you seen the prices of bachelor suites and one bedroom apartments? The very basics of housing? We still can't get our corrupt city, provincial, and federal leaders to work together and with private sector to get mass medium and high density housing construction actually going to help us..
Immigration is massively abused for cheap exploitable labor and a larger consumer base for higher profits that a class that already has no problems got to enjoy all the fruits of. Sadly our political leaders from city, provincial, and federal levels are usually part of this class or buddy buddy with it and this is why it took them so long to even acknowledge the housing crisis existed despite how loud and how long the voices of pain and suffering were here in Canada.
The international student program is so bad for misuse and abuse of our food banks some food banks have stopped allowing this demographic to use their services. That and the need is too high. Maybe our standards are not correct for this program...? We also have the sickening videos and other things we all know about in regards to how to rip off these services and support systems floating around..
Temporary Foreign Worker Program - My god Justin and Singh talked about this themselves. Then in power they made it a million times worse. We already had one scandal here and this one is much much bigger. Funny how money and power corrupt..
Lastly the ""refugee"" and ""asylum"" pathways. My god we saw how these were exploited and scammed across the world. Did we decide to tighten our borders? Did we decide to plan ahead?
NOPE
Now we have this whole program massively scammed to high heavens and people that are not even Canadian citizens are filling our shelters, being put up in hotels, and making government spending at city, provincial, and federal level even higher.
I guess though as long as all of this profits the wealth class that involves politicians and private sector leaders it is all okay though right?
All the negative societal costs going on the middle class backs that are barely above water at this point.
We need to get back to common sense and basic math.
If you bring in vastly more people than you do housing development in a year that is going to cause issues around accessibility and affordability.
If that continues year after year that is going to lead to a crisis of accessibility and affordability of housing.
This same basic math goes for all societal infrastructure.
Politicians and associated organizations lie and mislead all the time.
Basic math does not.
We can't take care of the rest of the world and have no standards.
We have our own people sleeping in tents like refugee camps in third world countries.
We have our own people skipping meals and record high food bank usage.

Damn, lots of mad Americans replied to my post! Too many to catch you all, so I'm editing for one and all.
First off, no I'm not anti-American, I'm anti-being lectured about covid by a country that completely botched their covid response.
Second, the thing about having a totalitarian dictatorship in Australia is that this is a fabrication by right wing media for the consumption of low IQ gullible twats. Here's the real story that Fox news doesn't want you to know:
- Part of the country has had lockdowns for part of the pandemic in order to prevent our hospital systems being overwhelmed.
- Many if not most Western nations also had lockdowns, Australia is nothing special in this regard.
- The reason that we were having lockdowns after all the other countries that also had lockdowns cancelled their lockdowns is because our Federal government failed to roll out the vaccines on schedule. Back in June 2021 when Delta struck Australia just about everyone in the US and UK had been vaccinated if they wanted and we were at something like 10% vaccinations.
- Now we're hitting our vaccination targets, our two most populous states, NSW and Victoria, have opened back up.
That's it, that's the whole story. Lockdowns like everyone else that had lockdowns, but later on because of an incompetent Federal government. Lockdowns that either have now ended or were never imposed beyond a few days for the majority of the Australian population.
Stop being hysterical Americans, there is literally nothing to see here...except of course a lesson in how to manage pandemics.

Despite being elected in 2007 with a commitment to continue boat turn-backs, the green-Left inside the Rudd Labor administration had its way. Turn-backs ceased, and offshore detention and temporary visas were abolished – only for the boats, predictably enough, to start up again. Over the next six years, more than 800 boats came to Australia, with nearly 50,000 people aboard. At least 1,000 are thought to have died in the attempt. At its peak, there were 5,000 arrivals in one month alone.
When I became prime minister in 2013, I knew something had to be done to fix this. What changed? First, offshore processing in Nauru and also in Papua New Guinea resumed. Most significantly, Operation Sovereign Borders commenced. My government built on the Howard formula: boat turn-backs to stop people leaving for Australia in the first place, offshore processing so that those who were picked up at sea never made it to Australia, and temporary visas so that those who did get here couldn’t stay.
Crucially, we added a unified command structure under military leadership for all the agencies involved, a media blackout for individual boat arrivals (because this had served as “shipping news for people smugglers”), and – when boats were scuttled, forcing our navy to pick up their occupants – putting would-be migrants on to unsinkable lifeboats just outside Indonesia’s 12-mile limit with only enough fuel to make it back to Java.
At the beginning, only one of the government’s most senior officials thought that stopping the boats was even achievable. One of them went so far as to claim that it could cause conflict with Indonesia. My response was that if illegal boats were leaving Australia for Indonesia, with only perfunctory efforts made to stop them, the Indonesians would regard us as conniving in an unfriendly act.
When official advice emerged that the turn-backs might be illegal under international law, I demanded we seek better advice. A country that can’t stop people entering without permission is suffering a form of peaceful invasion.",2024-02-16T21:58:50.770Z,-0.8989,negative,"australian border force officials, beagle bay, asylum seekers arrives"

The trouble is, very few migrants arriving in Australia come with the skills to build the extra homes we need.
Migrants are less likely to work in construction than in most other industries. About 32% of Australian workers were foreign born, but only about 24% of workers in building and construction were born overseas.

1923xeq,Why the benefits of surging migration are vastly exaggerated,2024-01-09T02:46:28.017Z,"By Judith Sloan
January is a slow news month in Australia, particularly when it comes to economic and business matters. Most business leaders have headed for the beach or overseas to ski down pristine slopes. A few will head to Davos next week to attend the latest World Economic Forum confab.
Seeing a gap in the market, audit and consulting firm KPMG has taken to releasing an annual survey of a small number of senior business figures in early January. Entitled Keeping Us Up at Night, the short report outlines the main factors that are concerning the respondents. Note here that most of KPMG’s clients are big businesses and government departments.
According to the results, top concerns for the next 12 months and the next three to five years are “dealing with cyber risks, and talent issues, including recruitment/retention and upskilling the workforce for a digital world”.
KPMG chief economist Brendan Rynne provided additional commentary to the report, including a plea to the government to refrain from cutting the migrant intake. “We’ve got to be careful that we don’t have a knee-jerk reaction and I think that the government’s response hasn’t been: it’s been considered and positive.”
He noted the “work we’ve done has consistently shown that skilled migration adds positively to the Australian economy and it does that through improvements in productivity.”
Referring to the acute shortage of housing, he added: “I’d actually live with the short-term challenges that we’ve got at the moment. I think ultimately that the market will sort itself out with regard to housing investment and I’d rather do that than turn away skilled migrants who are unlikely to come back later.”
But are any of these assertions consistent with the evidence? And just to be picky, I’m pretty sure Rynne personally is not living with the short-term challenges – for example, lining up to secure high-priced rental accommodation.
Consider the supposed link between skilled migration and higher productivity, leading to broad economic benefits. Notwithstanding Rynne telling us he has work that demonstrates this link, there is little rigorous Australian research to back the claim. Indeed, in terms of recent trends, the evidence is the opposite: the surging rates of migrant intake that occurred in the 2010s and have restarted after the Covid-induced lull have been associated with sluggish productivity growth, much lower than was apparent in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The immediate effect of immigration is to dilute the capital stock, which has a negative effect on productivity. It is only over time that this capital-shallowing effect can be offset by investment. The sad reality is, absent the mining sector, this investment has failed to materialise in Australia.
Throughout this recent period, governments have emphasised skilled migration in relation to the permanent migrant intake. Of the 190,000 permanent annual places, 137,000 or 72 per cent are allocated to the skill stream, with the remaining to the family stream (mainly partner visas). This high percentage of skilled migration has been a pattern for many years.
But the permanent intake is only a proportion of the total migrant intake. According to the latest figures, there were more than 500,000 long-term net migrant arrivals in the year ending in June 2023. The permanent intake is only 40 per cent of the total number of new migrants. In turn, most migrant arrivals are international students who cannot be deemed skilled although they do take unskilled and semi-skilled jobs. To be sure, there are temporary workers among the intake and some of them are highly skilled, but not all.
The number of international student visas granted in 2022-23 was more than 550,000. In addition, there were nearly 200,000 temporary graduate visa holders in June last year, an increase of more than 100 per cent on the June 2022 figure.
It may be tempting to equate graduates with skilled workers, but we know from a range of data sources that the employment of international graduates is much less concentrated in professional and managerial occupation than domestic graduates. According to a survey of graduate outcomes in 2022, 58 per cent of international graduates were employed full time compared with close to 80 per cent of domestic graduates. The median salary of international graduates employed full time was less than 90 per cent of domestic graduates. The reality is, many international graduates are employed in semi-skilled, routine jobs.
Rynne may have a point for specific cases where particular skills are required for certain investments to go ahead or for certain firms to grow. But we are talking about relatively small numbers where the employer-sponsored visa categories deal with these needs. In any case, a better and more sustainable solution is for firms to invest in the training of workers with these specialised skills rather than simply bringing in migrant workers.
As for the housing market adjusting to market forces and provid­ing ample, affordable accommodation for the rapidly growing population driven by immigration, again the evidence doesn’t favour Rynne’s sanguinity. If anything, market forces are working in the opposite direction, with rising interest rates, higher material costs, worker shortages and planning/approval delays leading to far fewer homes being built than are required.
Indeed, there were fewer new apartments built last year than had been the case for more than a decade. The housing situation is not just a short-term challenge. There is a widespread consensus that the federal government’s target of 1.2 million homes to be built across five years will not be met.
As for the government’s response to the surging migrant intake, actions taken thus far have been feeble and small-scale, even though the rate of immigration is unpopular with voters. The hope is that the net overseas migration figure will settle back to levels deemed to be acceptable – about 250,000 a year, which is still high.
But a few regulatory tweaks will not fix the problem, particularly as many on temporary visas are highly capable of gaming the system. Witness the recent uptick in applications for humanitarian visas as an example.
The bottom line is this: the surge in net overseas migration is unsustainable; overwhelmingly, the new migrants are not skilled; and the pressures on the housing market will not ease noticeably until the migrant intake is deliberately and substantially reduced.
Big businesses, universities and property developers will vocally oppose any moves to restrict immigration because it is not in their interests to do so.
It’s also important to acknowledge the effects of large migrant intakes extend well beyond the labour market and housing. They include more congestion, greater demand on facilities such as schools, hospitals and utilities, and the loss of social amenity. The government needs to consider this broader picture and to act with haste to rein in the migrant intake as well as speed up the exit of many temporary migrants.",2024-01-09T02:48:12.661Z,0.9887,neutral,

The students had been told they were admitted to a well known post-secondary school, entered Canada on student visas, then were told by the recruiter that the university no longer had space, so they would have to attend private colleges.
After completing their studies, border services accused the students of committing fraud and sent out 700 deportation notices. While the government stepped in to freeze the order, a number had already left—some voluntarily, others by force.
Considering Indian media covered the issue extensively, Canada likely developed a reputation overseas. At least when it comes to smaller, lesser known schools.

I also feel that there should be waaaay more checks and balances in place by the government. There are far too many “international students” getting into Canada on falsified acceptance letters and even though some have been caught and deported, those numbers are a drop in a bucket into the amount who are still here. They are not in school. They are not in classes. They are not in the schools they said they were accepted into and used fraudulent information to gain access into Canada. They are just here working under false pretenses. There should be some sort of check on each student with each school confirming they are here and attending school. If not, they are deported for fraudulently entering Canada under false pretenses.
The last thing is that schools should not pass students who do not show up or do not do the work. All you hear is students not doing the work and still getting degrees. That makes a joke out of our education system and degrades the degrees of those students who actually do the work and show up.

I would add that there should be something in there that addresses fraud (like people paying others to pass their English tests) and the impact that has in education for domestic students. We cannot be lowering standards to accommodate people who don’t have a good grasp of English. It’s not just bad for the economy, as having a poorly educated population leads to skill shortages, but it also devalues credentials and wastes people’s time and money. There are students who worked very hard over many years to get their degrees from Conestoga 10 years ago who now have to deal with employers writing off their education as being from a “diploma mill”. This is so beyond unacceptable. With growth in technology I don’t understand the obsession that colleges have with growing and building new campuses. Why does everything have to grow? Quality over quantity would be a better approach. And by the way, this was a problem 01 years ago and when I wrote my MPP about it I was told that Ontario has “world-class education”.

You can schedule a call with them and they will essentially take you through the entire process, even going through your transcript and telling you which universitates you are competitive for. They also will handle all your applications on your behalf, and work with you through the entire process at no cost.
I think given your particular situation, they might also give you advice on how proceed as an international student studying in the US and what resources are available for you. I will also mention that you do not need to sit the GAMSAT (unless you need to for a personal reason), all Canadian and American internationals applying to postgraduate medical programs in Australia are assessed based on GPA and MCAT (Here is a table for the 2024 GPA 4.0 scale and MCAT requirements from OzTREKK)

You do two preclinical years in Australia and then do two clinical years in the US. I’m pretty sure you should write the MCAT anyways instead of GAMSAT as that will allow you to apply to US schools too.
I’m Canadian so I only know Oztrekk, but you should reach out to them anyways because even if they didn’t cover this program they can refer you to an agency that does.",2024-07-05T05:29:57.046Z,0.5187,neutral,international student

12o3f7v,Which English test is best for post study work visa?,2023-04-16T10:01:33.345Z,"For Visa 485 (post study work visa) the English language requirement is as follows:
- IELTS: Overall score of at least 6 with a minimum score of 5 for each of the 4 parts (Reading, Listening, Writing, Speaking)
- PTE: Overall score of at least 50 with a minimum score of 36 for each of the 4 parts.
You should already have a language test result that you used for your Australian study. Check the expiry date for that one, you might not have to seat for one again. The result is usually valid for 3 years.
IELTS and PTE are the primary tests everyone prefers. PTE is relatively easier, but for the requirements of this visa, both are easy to get the desired score. Both tests have an academic and a general version. For Australia, only PTE Academic is available, which costs $385*. The price may vary a little depending on which organisation you're registering with. You can seat for IELTS general training (academic one is harder, not needed for 485). IELTS General Training costs $395*. Again, this might vary a little depending on which organisation you're registering with. By registration organisation, I mean, there are multiple organisations that arrange the tests on behalf of Pearson (PTE) or British Council (IELTS). You'll see the list when you're booking and can choose the nearest test centre to you. Best of luck!

15ugx7u,Post Study work visa rejection possibilities,2023-08-18T10:39:08.051Z,"I think some different matters are getting mixed up here, and it’s not just you. So much misinformation is being generated and recycled.
Here’s the tea. A Student Visa requires you to be in the UK during term time participating in your course. The university monitors that. If you want or need to leave the UK during term-time, you need to check that the university agrees to that. If they don’t, and you leave anyway, they could in theory withdraw sponsorship for the Student visa. Seems harsh, and it probably hardly ever happens.
There is no separate or differently-counted requirement around term-time absence for the Graduate visa. There is the “Study in the UK” requirement, but by confirming to the Home Office that you are eligible to apply for a Graduate visa, the university is confirming that you meet the “Study in the UK” requirement, i.e. that you were studying in the UK when they required you to be. The university monitors your attendance and absence. The Home Office has no separate interest in it, unless the university instructs them to cancel your Student visa for lack of engagement with your studies.
The idea that the Home Office is doing a deep-dive check of every Graduate applicants’ travel to try to catch them travelling during term-time and refuse their visa is a big myth. In some versions of the story they are even trying to catch people travelling in vacations! It’s all nonsense. It is passed around as gossip and won’t go away. It seems to be based on a misunderstanding and conflation of the aforementioned “Study in the UK” requirement and the “world travel history” question on the application. The latter is a standard question on every UK visa and leave to remain application, and is nothing whatsoever to do with eligibility for the Graduate visa.
I work in this field and I have seen detailed data on Graduate visa refusals. First, there are hardly any. Second, they are almost all because someone applied before they had their eligible qualification, sometimes part-way through the course. And like with all types of visa there is a tiny number refused under the General grounds for criminality, etc. There are no refusals for absence from the UK during term time - if that was a problem, the university would have triggered cancellation of the Student visa anyway.

You can return to the UK as long as your visa is valid, but if you have finished your course, then there is a small risk it could be cancelled at the border due to the fact that your visa terms no longer apply. If your course end date is the 17th and you are due to return on the 16th, then I highly doubt it will be a problem",2023-08-18T10:44:58.329Z,-0.9237,negative,post study work visa rejection possibilities

First you can not apply to a 485 before you have officially completed your phd.
Also you can not extend a student visa. You have to apply for a new one. The university will give you a letter which should explain the situation and that you will submit with your new visa.
Lastly, be careful with the 485,they are strict on the conditions: must have a non expired English test + apply for a NFP before lodging your 485.",2021-09-22T10:25:13.335Z,0.5239,neutral,post study work visa

I loved the experience of studying overseas! So that's something you should factor in - will you enjoy the course and your life outside the classroom more at UTS than on another similar program (in your country or in another country)?
The other questions I would be asking is how you think this degree will be received when you return home and what the job market is like where you're from. Remember that a behavioural economics degree could lead down a few paths (behavioural eco, yes, but also market research and insights work, policy work, more eco or finance work and probably other things) - so you can think about what associated things you might be interested in persuing and look at the markets for those as well.
It's really great that you have identified a couple of things you know you are less interested in! My advice would be to avoid those - if behavioural economics is what you're most interested in then at least this master's will be more interesting and fun for you than any other masters. And then at the end you will be on track to work somewhere more aligned with that. Clinical psych is a tough grind - I definitely don't think you would want to do that unless you're super into it.
(Note that the whole ""follow your passions"" advice is contingent on a certain amount of financial and other types of security so make the call that's right for you!)
Finally, I don't know anything about working without a visa in the BI industry - apologies. Sponsorship may be an option but I hear it's tricky and does tie you to an employer for a long time, which can be disadvantageous. There is probably a visa Reddit (or outside Reddit source!) that could tell you more.

With that context: you're going at this backwards. First you need to figure out what career makes sense for your life, considering your aptitudes, interests, national (for you) and global trends, and only then figure out how to get there.
A degree without a plan and goal is a waste of time and money.
About this specific degree, my opinion is that it's highly unlikely to increase your career prospects, because no one is clamoring to hire Economics Masters degree holders, and because BE as a field has had some reputational setbacks recently. But this last paragraph doesn't matter - before starting any other degree, first you need to have a goal in mind.

1btitn6,Working visa experiences in Australia?,2024-04-01T23:06:20.485Z,"You've got a year long visa so you'll probably want to move around. But a lot depends on how much you're planning on working and what your skills are. There's also the question of if you are going to try and get your 88 days to extend your visa for another year.
If you're not worried about extending your visa and you don't mind working hospitality stuff then a big city is a good place to start. But keep in mind that the Australian rental market is pretty absurd right now so finding a flat can be quite difficult (or so I've been told).
If you want to extend your visa you basically have to go somewhere rural. It's also a good option to save money since some jobs will offer room and board if you commit to a period of time. But you might end up in a working hostel to do your days/save some money and that experience can really depend on your personality. I personally loved it, but I also know people who went home/gave up after a few weeks.
As a side note pay is very similar wherever you are in Australia, most jobs that are available to backpackers will be casual positions based on what are called ""award rates"" which are basically industry wide contracts that lay out pay, breaks, overtime, etc..",2024-04-02T00:18:17.092Z,0.9869,neutral,visa experiences
