1cwjvlj,A question about Visa 485 requirement,2024-05-20T16:34:45.568Z,6 months from when you found out you completed all course requirements. Why are your parents getting involved with your visa application anyway?,2024-05-20T20:19:17.180Z,0.0,neutral,0.0,neutral,
1cwjvlj,A question about Visa 485 requirement,2024-05-20T16:34:45.568Z,"To break it down and put this in simple terms, you should apply for the 485 visa after your course completion date and not after your current dates of Ur COE nor your student visa.
What I would recommend is to start your application once you have the transcripts for your degree. As to why they want you to be in Australia during the application is because of a few reasons:
Immigration policy: The 485 visa is designed for international students who have completed their studies in Australia and want to gain work experience or extend their stay in the country. By requiring applicants to be in Australia, the government ensures that they have already demonstrated a commitment to studying and living in the country.
Visa integrity: This requirement helps maintain the integrity of the visa program by reducing the risk of fraudulent applications or individuals attempting to bypass visa requirements.
Assessing eligibility: Being in Australia allows the government to verify an applicant's identity, academic qualifications, and work experience more easily, ensuring they meet the necessary eligibility criteria.
Streamlined processing: By being in Australia, applicants can provide biometric data and attend an interview if required, making the application process more efficient.
Integration and settlement: The government encourages international students to stay in Australia and contribute to the economy and society. By requiring them to be in the country, they can start building connections, finding employment, and integrating into the community.
Plus at the date of your submitted 485 visa, you would be issued with a bridging visa A and it kinda extents your stay further in Australia. So why not :) hope this helps!",2024-05-20T22:14:10.609Z,0.0,neutral,0.9643,positive,

I would say focus on gaining skills for now, that is the only option we have. Make sure that you have an edge in the labour market. Nevertheless, they will bring a new visa, Skills in Demand, this will really be beneficial to critical sectors, and I believe IT is one of them.
So don't stress much, focus on what you have at hand right now.
If you studied from a university located in a regional area, you can have 3 years worth of 485. Which is sufficient enough to find a good job or an employer who can sponsor you.

16eucul,Question on Visa 485 for returning student,2023-09-10T07:55:09.404Z,"I'm somewhat confused, you want the 485? My understanding is that you need to have graduated at an Australian university as you have WITHIN 6 months of finishing, which you havent. However, if you are coming back for a masters degree you can just have another student visa? Then if you wish to stay after the masters get the 485",2023-09-10T08:27:52.260Z,0.0,neutral,0.2708,positive,

1dlijni,485 visa refusal,2024-06-22T00:05:07.526Z,"I'd assume you have not applied for a Police Check before? Because it would take 2 weeks for it to be completed and the result letter to be sent back to you. Pretty sure when DHA stated that they would only accept complete disclosure National Police Certificates issued by the Australian Federal Police so I am unsure a receipt would be considered as adequate proof for AFP PC or not. However I did hear anecdotal stories about this ""receipt"" thing where some people got free pass and some, well, ended up like you.
I believed there are two things you must do:
Hire another migration lawyer (a good one preferably) to represent you before the AAT should you decide to pursuit this venue. Best discuss with them about your chances of winning and how to best prepare for the trial.
Before you made the complaint to OMARA, ensure that you followed their guides to complain here: Before you make a complaint (mara.gov.au). However they will not be able to get your money back as you would have to go through with the Civil Court in your State for civil matter (in this case that would be a Breach of Contract from the agent side).
Best of luck but for the love of God please ensure ALL documents are present and valid at the time of submitting any visa application to save yourself all these hassles. Say you were properly misled by your MARA agent and able to overturn DHA's decision at the AAT, that would be months of waiting and thousands of dollars wasted just because you couldn't complete a $47 AFP Police Check before submission.
Also NEVER EVER trust your MARA agent 100%. Always double check everything. They are there because you didn't have time to lodge the application by yourself but whatever they lodged (or did not lodge), you would have to be aware and approve as well.

For the professional year, you can both study and have a full-time job but make sure to select the study day that doesn't conflict with your work.
There's a new points system that will be implemented in July 2025 or 2026, and the professional year will likely not be counted in the new system. I think DHA will annouce the full details later this year. If you can get a full-time job, the professional year might not be worth it, but it still provides you a guaranteed ACS skill assessment.

ijt8pb,Visa 485 post graduate work visa,2020-08-31T06:53:01.440Z,"I tell you the story of a my friend:
He finished his PhD last year, pretty clever guy.
He married an Australian girl. He decides to settle in Australia and lodge the 485 visa.
After a few months is rejected. He made a mistake in the application. (He didn't have a police record)
Only then he decides to go to a migration agent. And then he goes to the tribunal of appeals after one year. Result = denied.
He left Australia a few weeks ago. He has now to wait two years for the partner visa.
The first two details you mention are trivial, but not including family details is very serious. This could be enough to refuse your visa as you made a false statement. And I am even more worried about other mistakes you might have made...
You have been in Australia for so long, take this seriously and contact a migration agent TOMORROW!!!! Check your documents, at the very least, and fix any urgent issues.
If the visa is denied, there is nothing NOTHING you can do.",2020-08-31T07:02:06.284Z,0.0,neutral,-0.9429,negative,

What you need to do,
consult a reputable immigration agent immediately
the department has a internal policy where they wil preferably not grant less favourable visa if you already have a more favourable visa. So most probably someone didn't realise this. Try to reach out to the department, either through their call center or by uploading a letter in both of your student and 485 visa application. I have heard of cases where they have simply reversed the grant moving you back to original visa.
in all your dealings, completely own up to your mistake and donot try to blame the department. You insinuating that they should not have granted you 485 is wrong, you should have your withdrawn student visas but it is fixable.

This has always been one of my arguments for going with a Partner Visa despite the skilled visa's being cheaper and potentially take less time. You can't predict the future and you can't predict what sort of stunts the government is going to do next with temporary visa's.
With a Partner Visa you will get some more peace and can start thinking about saving up for a down deposit on a house. If your partner is earning more than you you might even be able to buy a house quicker than you think. After all the government is less likely to suddenly change the policy regarding Partner Visa's because it only makes up a very small amount of the immigration numbers.
I came to Australia in 2022 and applied for a Partner Visa in 2023. I still have about 6-8 months to wait until I can apply for the 801 partner visa (permanent) and then however long the grant takes which could be up to a year.

-you are not related by family

Realistically no one would study a nursing or teaching course in Australia (or anywhere besides their home country really lol) if they weren't trying for PR. Never made sense to me how there were multiple visa pathways (some of which don't even involve PR) that are only available after graduating from an Australian university yet you had to pretend you weren't interested in using any of them.

SYDNEY, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Australia on Monday said it would tighten visa rules for international students and low-skilled workers that could halve its migrant intake over the next two years as the government looks to overhaul what it said was a ""broken"" migration system.
The decision comes after net immigration was expected to have peaked at a record 510,000 in 2022-23. Official data showed it was forecast to fall to about a quarter of a million in 2024-25 and 2025-26, roughly in line with pre-COVID levels.
""We've worked around the clock to strike the best balance in Australia's migration system,"" Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said in a statement ahead of the formal release of the government's new migration strategy later on Monday.
""The government's targeted reforms are already putting downward pressure on net overseas migration, and will further contribute to this expected decline,"" O'Neil said.
O'Neil said the increase in net overseas migration in 2022-23 was mostly driven by international students.
Australia boosted its annual migration numbers last year to help key businesses recruit staff to fill shortages after the COVID-19 pandemic brought tighter border controls, and kept foreign students and workers out of the country for nearly two years.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese over the weekend said Australia's migration numbers needed to be wound back to a ""sustainable level,"" adding that ""the system is broken.""
Long reliant on immigration to supply what is now one of the tightest labour markets in the world, Australia's Labor government has pushed to speed up the entry of highly skilled workers and smooth their path to permanent residency.
Under the new policies, international students would need higher ratings on English tests. It will also end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay in Australia.
A new specialist visa for highly skilled workers will be set up with the processing time cut to one week, helping businesses recruit top migrants amid tough competition with other developed economies.

Whilst I dont know your specific circumstances do you NEED to be in Brisbane on the 8th Feb? Given its research based so no formal timings its unlikely your supervisor minds when exactly you start. If it's a PhD program and you let them know its waiting on a visa may delay you they'll be able to accommodate too!
If you haven't already and flight costs are a concern, some unis will cover flights over for international PhD students so definitely worth checking.

Here is some information that may help you relax:
Processing time for Postgrad research sector is high, but it does not really reflect the current processing speed.

2. The DoHA is prioritising Student Visa processing for several sectors including Postgrad research
https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/news-media/archive/article?itemId=1155
So I guess it is possible that you will receive your visa within Jan but it depends greatly on your application. Luckily, applications from fully funded Ph.D. candidates are considered strong ones and have a higher rate of success.
I would advise you to purchase your flight ticket (the type you can change route and flight time) to avoid increased price (this is what I did), and enquire your university about the deferral procedure (in case you need to defer your commencement).

I had only like 3k in my savings at that time, but it would be better if you have supporting information such as Payslips, work contract if you have job. Otherwise just your COE from your current Uni would be good. 
Yes! any supporting documents from your family in Europe will be great additional information, and they have to write something like Sponsorship paper (go check in the Visa application form if you are unsure)

side note: Kasal ako sa iba at my anak pero it didn't stop me for being granted as a sub sequent entrant as de facto nung naka work visa pa GF ko and now PR na kami dito.
we are just 1 year into our relationship before the processing of my visa that time, subsequent entrant de facto under visa 482. so 1 year worth of artifacts lang un.
May requirement na dapat nag live together etc etc kayo, what we did is matagal na sya sa condo unit na inuupahan nya, take note we didnt live togethet talaga haha. Dahil 3 years na ata sya sa unit nya renew renew lang e ung last renewal contract ay di sinend sa kanya kesa nga why not? di naman nag increase upa nya. Ayun hinabol namin un bago sya umalis sa unit nya, at dahil chummy chummy na nya may ari, pumayag ilagay ung name ko as co-renter nya. Meaning it's a strong document na magpapatunay na nag live in kami kahit hinde haha. aun ninotarized un. (feel ko ito ung malaking weight ng artifacts ko).
important din to, you need social shits artifacts like pics with family and friends. so aun we provided 6 months worth lang ng pics na kasama ko sya with her friends plus attended 2 weddings with her and pics with each other's family gathering.
Travels na together kayo, so aun bumili kami ng ticket pa HK hahah pero nacancel din ung flight, in our case promo fare lang nag no show lang kami pero palag pdin ung evidence na un plane tickets same flight and date so travel plan un. What we did was nag local travel lang kami ng isang beses! haha tagaytay nga lang un lang pinakita namin.
Financial artifact, Nag open lang kami bank account at nilagayan ng around 10kiaw then naiwan nya CC bills nya sa pinas ginawa nya nag sesend sya ng money sa account namin na un at un ibabayad ko sa CC bills nya sa pinas. Kaya nung pag kuha ko ng statement of account sa banko namin madaming transactions ng pera labas pasok kasi active ung joint account namin.

Does it matter which type of course? For example, could I pursue a certificate course or does it need to be a Bachelors/Masters?
It's fine as long as the course is registered on CRICOS but the visa duration will be set in line with the course, usually 1 month longer than your COE to give you time to pack up and leave after you have finished your study. If you are studying a course that's not a Bachelor or higher, the Department of Home Affairs will also take into account the availability of such a course in your home country when deciding whether or not to grant you a visa, so for example if you're from the USA (for example) and applying for a student visa for a certificate of cookery or whatever, you will have some challenging questions posed to you about why you would want to spend an absolute fortune doing such a basic course in Australia when every community college in America could provide it to you for less.
If Im being completely honest, studying is secondary to the experience of living and working in Australia.
Study is the priority of a student visa. Coming to Australia on a student visa for the purpose of engaging in work is a breach of visa conditions and your visa will be refused or cancelled if the government gets even a whiff of what you are up to.
Enrolling in a research based Masters means you have no limit on your work rights, but other student visa holders are capped at 48 hours per fortnight which you may recognise is absolutely nothing and will probably not be enough to support yourself long term, which is why student visa applications need you to demonstrate you can already financially support yourself before you arrive.

1bowlhz,Tourist Visa Denied,2024-03-27T08:07:40.633Z,"Can I call someone at the Department of Home Affairs to figure outwhat exactly they deemed inadequate for my application and further proof I can provide?
They will just refer you to the letter and won't give you any info beyond that so don't waste your time.
How long do I need to wait to reapply?
You can reapply immediately if you want, but you will need more proof- if you just reapply with mostly the same documentation they'll reject you instantly. I think that your SG student visa expiry really hurt you here, unfortunately.
Would I need to go back to the VFS office and do a biometric collection even though they now have my fingerprints in their system (it's 85 SGD exclusive of the 190 dollar application fee that I really do not want to have to pay again)
I am actually not sure about this but I think that biometrics are per application. If that's right, then yes- you will need to do that again (which I agree is very dumb)
I have family in Sydney that I plan to visit. Would it make more sense to ask them to write a letter on my behalf (they've already agreed) and apply under the sponsored visa stream instead. I did not do this the first time since I only plan to be in Sydney 2 days out of a 2 week trip.

1: Please refer to my answer for Q3.
2: Nothing is a guarantee as it's all a waiting game and the government is prioritising 'in demand' roles at the moment - mainly healthcare.
3: WHV has a long history of foreigners to stay and work in Australia after working for an employer beyond the 6 months. This is because it gives both employers and employees the chance to see if both parties are happy with each other. Think of it as a probationary period.
As the Data Scientist is currently still not in the Skilled Occupation List - my advice as per the linked thread, is to use an occupation that is close to what you have been working in.
Also it would be a better idea to seek advice from a Registered Migration Agent to see what your options are.",2024-01-21T18:14:35.544Z,0.0,neutral,0.885,positive,

South Africa is the last country that should be criticizing other countries for being racist, when they are about to pass legislation that allows for the government to seize land from farms without compensation, which will most likely be used to target white-owned farms. While South African leader Julius Malema makes statements like ""We are not calling for the slaughter of white people - at least for now"".

I have been going to Australia every 3-5 years since I was a kid because I have family there and never had issues. I had friends submit their application later than mine and got theirs approved.Then covid happened anyway. Good thing MAS refunded my ticket due to covid.
2 years later (2022) they sent me a reason for rejection saying they closed their borders due to covid. But I know that's not true because they were still approving visas after my first submission.

For example, there was someone with an IT background who wanted to apply for a 462 visa. One of the conditions of this visa is that you cannot work for the same employer for more than 6 months. While this condition does not apply to all industries, IT is not exempt. Additionally, it is rare for an employer in this industry to hire someone who will stay for only 6 months. Truth be told, common jobs for WHV holders are au pair, farm work, and retail. I'm not belittling these jobs; ang sa akin lang, it's important for prospective Filipino applicants not to expect that the 'professional' setting they had in the Philippines will be the same here in Australia.",2024-07-03T00:12:26.746Z,0.4019,positive,0.4222,positive,holiday visa subclass

From July 1, the international student visa fee has risen to $1,600 from $710. The federal government said the additional revenue will help fund initiatives in education including cuts to graduate debt, financial support for apprentices, and the ongoing implementation of its migration strategy......
.....Phil Honeywood, CEO of the International Education Association of Australia, told the ABC that the announcement was the ""last straw"" for the international education sector, which has already suffered from a slowdown in visa approvals.""We are really in danger of losing a $48 billion a year industry,"" Mr Honeywood said....
.....The increase is part of the government's move to curb net migration which rose to a record 528,000 people in 2022-2023 after COVID restrictions were removed.
Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said the changes will create ""a migration system which is fairer, smaller and better able to deliver for Australia,"" in a statement.
Senior migration lawyer Sean Dong told the ABC he believed the decision would severely impact the intake number of international students in the next few years. Around 440,000 hopeful international students applied for a student visa from July 2023 to May 2024.""It is not going to be a good solution, it will impact the revenue stream of the universities,"" he added.The visa fee hike follows plans to cap the number of international students.

How did you find a job? How did you find a place to live?
How do you prepare before arriving? Could you find a job or a place to live (or both) before arriving? Did you save significantly before going off on the working holiday?
Similarly, are most jobs eligible for this visa enough to cover the cost of living?
i would love to hear more about your experience, especially any tips you have or advice on what you would do differently/in hindsight.

196yyhu,Current trend of getting working holiday visa in Australia,2024-01-15T03:40:38.871Z,"20 tahun di Australia, dan tahu visa2 dan seluk beluk tinggal di Australia.
Sebelumnya....realitas kerja WHV tahun 2022 (tidak ada batasan kerja 6 bulan di satu perusahaan, dengan pengecualian tertentu) itu beda dengan tahun 2023 dan sangat beda dengan tahun 2024. Yang di sosial media itu realitas anak2 tahun 2022-2023. Anak WHV sampai Australia tahun 2022 itu bisa dapat kerja dalam waktu beberapa hari setelah mendarat. Anak WHV sampai Australia tahun 2024 itu lebih susah cari kerjanya.
Australia is also known with its great work life balance culture too (35 hours/week is the norm)
Kalau WHV, kerjanya bakal lebih dari ini kalau mau ngejar di atas 1000-1500 AUD per minggu.
What happens after the visa expires?
Pulang, atau :
apply student visa untuk sekolah di sekolah ecek2 demi meneruskan kerja blue collarnya, dan seringnya nanti ambil cash karena student visa holder ada batasan waktu kerjanya (48 jam per 2 minggu).
disponsorin visa kerja. Ini tergantung skill, pengalaman kerja dan ijazah kamu sekarang. Tidak mustahil, tapi unlikely. Yang saya tahu rata2 IT (programmer dll) atau chef. Kalau mau kamu silakan sebutin kerja,skill dan ijazah. Saya percaya diri bisa 75persenan bilang bisa atau tidak. Sekali lagi, jalan ini unlikely.
apply student visa untuk sekolah beneran di Australia, demi mencari PR (Permanent Resident). Jadi kerja WHVnya itu untuk modal sekolah di Australia. Ini perjuangan agak berat dan kemungkinan besar harus ganti karir dan skill. Nursing, aged care, IT, dll. Rata2 pada ambil aged care atau nursing.
Does taking a break from your career to work in a different field make it challenging to return to your original path?
Saya pribadi menyarankan WHV sebagai bahan mencari modal usaha (resign dari pekerjaan sebelumnya selamanya) atau beli rumah (bekerja lagi di Indonesia, tergantung bisa atau tidak).",2024-01-15T04:13:17.677Z,0.4019,positive,0.9295,positive,"current trend, holiday visa"
196yyhu,Current trend of getting working holiday visa in Australia,2024-01-15T03:40:38.871Z,"20 tahun di Australia, dan tahu visa2 dan seluk beluk tinggal di Australia.
Sebelumnya....realitas kerja WHV tahun 2022 (tidak ada batasan kerja 6 bulan di satu perusahaan, dengan pengecualian tertentu) itu beda dengan tahun 2023 dan sangat beda dengan tahun 2024. Yang di sosial media itu realitas anak2 tahun 2022-2023. Anak WHV sampai Australia tahun 2022 itu bisa dapat kerja dalam waktu beberapa hari setelah mendarat. Anak WHV sampai Australia tahun 2024 itu lebih susah cari kerjanya.
Australia is also known with its great work life balance culture too (35 hours/week is the norm)
Kalau WHV, kerjanya bakal lebih dari ini kalau mau ngejar di atas 1000-1500 AUD per minggu.
What happens after the visa expires?
Pulang, atau :
apply student visa untuk sekolah di sekolah ecek2 demi meneruskan kerja blue collarnya, dan seringnya nanti ambil cash karena student visa holder ada batasan waktu kerjanya (48 jam per 2 minggu).
disponsorin visa kerja. Ini tergantung skill, pengalaman kerja dan ijazah kamu sekarang. Tidak mustahil, tapi unlikely. Yang saya tahu rata2 IT (programmer dll) atau chef. Kalau mau kamu silakan sebutin kerja,skill dan ijazah. Saya percaya diri bisa 75persenan bilang bisa atau tidak. Sekali lagi, jalan ini unlikely.

196yyhu,Current trend of getting working holiday visa in Australia,2024-01-15T03:40:38.871Z,"So... I'm Australian and have a lot of friends who are currently on or were on WHV. Most of these friends arrived pre-covid and are only just finishing their 4 or 5 years on WHV/Covid visas etc. These people had the best experience because they were able to stay and work for more than the normal 3 years (due to covid visas), they had no competition for jobs (WHV holders left australia during covid, so people who stayed were able to get better jobs) and they were able to access a range of government free money (eg relocation assistance, money to take a covid test).
It is more difficult now for Indonesians to get the best jobs in Australia when on WHV and in my experience this is because they aim too low compared to other nationalities. Many Koreans who arrive have a very solid plan in place to take the best jobs (like operating a forklift) whereas many Indonesians just try and get any job they can to fill their bank accounts. That's OK, but you always need to be trying to get a better job in a better industry.
I think WHV is the best opportunity for many young Indonesians to save money. It is realistic to save 600jt+ in one year. Even more if you have a friend to share costs with and you can keep working all through the year.
Many Indonesian friends of mine don't want to return to Indonesia after working in Australia because they can't see themselves ever working for UMR in Indonesia again. Most of them try and use the money they saved doing WHV to search for a pathway to PR (usually via study, sometimes by marrying an Australian).
As a general rule, the best jobs for WHV workers are in cotton gin, winery, almonds harvest, rice harvest, grain harvest, solar farm. These jobs are very competitive and it's difficult to get one if you don't have any experience. You will usually start in the harder jobs like picking blueberries or mangoes and if you manage to get a job on a farm driving a machine (loader, forklift, tractor), you have a better chance of getting one of the good jobs in cotton, grain or winery.
One last recommendation. Go regional. Staying in the cities and working as a barista can be a nice lifestyle, but you won't save any money. You need to go regional and stay there. It's where the money is, following the seasons. Oh, and never work for an Indonesian.
Good luck!",2024-01-15T10:41:19.222Z,0.4019,positive,0.9982,positive,"current trend, holiday visa"

BRASILIA Brazil's government is considering waiving visas for visitors from the United States, Japan, Canada and Australia to boost tourism, and could eventually extend the plan to include China, a tourism ministry spokesman said on Monday.
The minister's proposal still needs approval by other departments of the Brazilian government, particularly the foreign ministry which issues the visas and has demanded reciprocity to exempt U.S. citizens from needing visas.
Visitors from most Latin American and European Union nations, and Russia, do not need visas to travel to Brazil, but U.S. travelers have to cough up $160 for a visa to visit Brazil, an identical fee charged to Brazilians for visas to visit the United States.

Legally, the 651 visa requires you to be a ""genuine temporary entrant"" (GTE). There is no fixed legal definition of what this means, and in reality, that gives DHA decision-makers and border officers a degree of freedom to exercise their subjective judgement.
The most common way in which the ""frowned upon"" element is manifested is when you're re-entering the country, where border agents may question you about your intentions (we've all seen the show Border Security).
The more serious way you could run afoul of the law would be a notice of intention to consider cancellation, however this is usually rare unless you are exiting and re-entering in a really obvious way to subvert the GTE requirement over multiple occasions.
Neither of these appear to have happened to you. As long as things stay that way, you are unlikely to see any consequences of being ""frowned upon"" by the Department.
Will you run into trouble if you keep exiting and re-entering several times a year, and keep reapplying for 651s year after year to maintain de facto residence? Yes, absolutely. Will it happen with your current movement history? Unlikely.
Hopefully it is clear that both ends of the opinion spectrum that people have mentioned are correct - this is not a simple black & white issue.
In terms of its impact on your partner visa application - as long as your 651 is not subject to enforcement action, you should not have any issues making a partner visa application. The main focus is whether you meet the eligibility criteria of the partner visa itself - which is dependent on your personal circumstances and a different topic of discussion.
Hope that helps.

18wiwwg,Will it be okay?,2024-01-02T06:40:19.985Z,"Bit of a disagreement among previous commenters about whether leaving and re-entering to reset the stay period will be ""frowned upon"". I'm a little late to the thread but just wanted to provide some context around this.
Legally, the 651 visa requires you to be a ""genuine temporary entrant"" (GTE). There is no fixed legal definition of what this means, and in reality, that gives DHA decision-makers and border officers a degree of freedom to exercise their subjective judgement.
The most common way in which the ""frowned upon"" element is manifested is when you're re-entering the country, where border agents may question you about your intentions (we've all seen the show Border Security).
The more serious way you could run afoul of the law would be a notice of intention to consider cancellation, however this is usually rare unless you are exiting and re-entering in a really obvious way to subvert the GTE requirement over multiple occasions.
Neither of these appear to have happened to you. As long as things stay that way, you are unlikely to see any consequences of being ""frowned upon"" by the Department.
Will you run into trouble if you keep exiting and re-entering several times a year, and keep reapplying for 651s year after year to maintain de facto residence? Yes, absolutely. Will it happen with your current movement history? Unlikely.
Hopefully it is clear that both ends of the opinion spectrum that people have mentioned are correct - this is not a simple black & white issue.
In terms of its impact on your partner visa application - as long as your 651 is not subject to enforcement action, you should not have any issues making a partner visa application. The main focus is whether you meet the eligibility criteria of the partner visa itself - which is dependent on your personal circumstances and a different topic of discussion.
Hope that helps.

14alm3t,Australia's visa overhaul leaves Chinese millionaires in limbo,2023-06-16T03:17:05.492Z,"I don't want to get into the politics of whether we should have more or less immigration overall, but one thing seems clear: we can all agree that the current system is seriously inefficient.
We're looking at around 120 visa types, a staggering bureaucracy, a million people waiting in the pipeline, and processing times that drag out for half a decade or more. Meanwhile, migrants are being cornered into sticking to one job and students are hitting rock-bottom trying to make ends meet with limited work hours. And let's not get started on the convoluted rules and costs involved in establishing relationships.
Why not ditch the whole administrative nightmare and bring economics into the game? We've all heard economists say that if demand greatly outstrips supply, then the price is too low. So why not apply that principle to visas? Imagine a ""visa rental"" system where we set the price such that the demand for visas equals the supply of visas (i.e., the number of people we're willing to let in). It would be a weekly rent and would add to government revenue.
This way, we're essentially ensuring that those who want to come in the most will be the ones coming in. By natural selection, job roles with a shortage would attract migrants, as these roles would offer higher pay than equivalent jobs overseas. This would also give local employees more bargaining power. And from the migrant's point of view, they'd have the freedom to change jobs once they're here without the fear of deportation looming over them.",2023-06-16T03:52:59.915Z,0.0,neutral,0.8752,positive,australia visa overhaul leaves chinese millionaires

I'm Australian but I did the WHV thing with my girlfriend. These are a couple of things I'd suggest:
we always had a place to stay, but from what I've observed with other backpackers, finding affordable accommodation can be an absolute nightmare, especially in Melbourne and Sydney. Look into it before you come. You can find Facebook groups where people advertise rooms and also use Gumtree.
get a car or a van ASAP, preferably something you can sleep in. Unless you want to stay in a big city the whole time, you will need it to truly experience Australia.
if you want to find work for your visa extension, don't just stick around towns along the East Coast, whether that be NSW or Queensland, or in Melbourne because that's what most people do. We found work just by turning up to random pubs in inland Queensland and enquiring.
if you want accommodation as part of the deal with work, you may have some luck on dairy farms or in rural/remote pubs. Bear in mind that working on a dairy farm SUCKS.
We've been doing it for more than a year now, so I may have other pieces of advice to impart if you want to send me a pm.

we always had a place to stay, but from what I've observed with other backpackers, finding affordable accommodation can be an absolute nightmare, especially in Melbourne and Sydney. Look into it before you come. You can find Facebook groups where people advertise rooms and also use Gumtree.
get a car or a van ASAP, preferably something you can sleep in. Unless you want to stay in a big city the whole time, you will need it to truly experience Australia.
if you want to find work for your visa extension, don't just stick around towns along the East Coast, whether that be NSW or Queensland, or in Melbourne because that's what most people do. We found work just by turning up to random pubs in inland Queensland and enquiring.
if you want accommodation as part of the deal with work, you may have some luck on dairy farms or in rural/remote pubs. Bear in mind that working on a dairy farm SUCKS.
We've been doing it for more than a year now, so I may have other pieces of advice to impart if you want to send me a pm.
Best of luck!",2024-01-03T06:12:58.736Z,0.4019,positive,0.9577,positive,work holiday visa

01-SEP-18 - 08-SEP-18, Spain, Holiday
05-JUL-19 - 08-JUL-19, Netherlands, Attending Wedding
They don't ask for visas or proof as far as I know. Most of my dates I had to do the same as you and either look up past flight/accommodation booking emails or look at photos and Facebook/Instagram.
There are a couple I can't remember the exact date, so I just put the month or guessed the best I could.
I think they appreciate humans are not infallible and they won't instantly reject your application because you can't remember exactly what date you went on a long weekend to Spain 9 years ago.
They will however reject you if they have reason to believe you've lied or misled them.
They might get suspicious if you have lots of Columbia to Brazil trips with vague dates and ask for further information but I doubt that's applicable to you.
I doubt they much care how many times you've been skiing in the alps or at an all inclusive in Benidorm.",2023-03-20T22:51:29.832Z,0.0,neutral,0.52,positive,visa application

Nijisanji IN was definitely a swing and a miss and had such a rocky history when you consider their temporary re-branding to Niji EN then back to IN once they started to hold auditions for an actual EN branch.
I do feel bad for Noor, Aadya and Vihaan though as I feel they were severly limited by their hardware. I remember giving them a shot when I first heard of them, but both Aadya and Vihaan had very laggy streams (whether because of their hardware or internet, who can say) and even Noor, the most popular of the group, had pretty bad audio on her streams.
I kinda hope we do get to see them again in the future, especially since they all do speak English well enough, but I can imagine that this whole experience could have soured the vtuber experience for them.

I figured it'd be fine to just wrap it up during the ceremony, I mean surely everyone would understand the importance of Miyamoto's baby. How was I to face graduation and adulthood, if I did not help Link face Ganon first. So I was glued to the screen the entire time, not clapping once for my classmates. I had to stay focused. I popped at least 5 red bulls and 7 five hour energies to stay alert while fighting moblins and dodongoes. I even made sure to give out a loud Link grunt (Yes that's Link not Zelda) every time he did in the game. I thought that must've invigorated the other graduates, they must've been inspired. When my name was called, I was in the midst of the final battle and did not hear it. The vile bully behind me (must've been a Sony Pony) pushed my gaze away and nudged me to prematurely accept my diploma. I politely urged him in the name of Reggie to stop but he became more and more angry. Why? Did he not want Link to succeed and save both Hyrule and Zelda? In a final act of cruelty, he took my switch and smashed it on the ground. At first I looked in horror at what he did to my splatoon oled, and then it turned to rage. I snapped and immediately tackled the fiend to the ground. I believe Iwata from the Heavens gave me strength, and so I bit his ear off. Icky blood squirted everywhere, glad that's not in any Nintendo classics! Afterwards, instead of the expected praise from the crowd, some brutes pushed me to the ground and held me there.

Most expats I know have lived in Kuwait for long enough or more to have been eligible for citizenship in other countries, had they moved there instead. I also think it's important to consider that countries where you have to pay tax aren't the outliers, it's countries that are tax-free like Kuwait that are the outliers. If people all over the world manage to do it, it surely can't be that difficult to eventually get adjusted to.
I personally am not conservative and would prefer a more liberal lifestyle, one in which people are not looked at differently based on religion, nationality, and gender. I would also prefer the freedom to drink and eat what I feel like and even have other people eat and drink what they feel like even if it's not something that my beliefs agree with( (unless it's weird, like cannibalism or something). I'd willingly give up some of the comforts Kuwait has to offer in exchange for these benefits.
Pretty sure I'm going to get the ""Then why are you here?"" question at some point and the reason why I am is that Kuwait is simply the best option I have at the moment. I don't hate the country (it's given me a lot for which I'm grateful) but I can't say it's somewhere I'd see myself living for much longer due to the reasons stated above.",2022-09-26T12:44:41.404Z,0.0,neutral,0.9631,positive,australia canada europe

REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw/File Photo)
AMSTERDAM, July 7 (Reuters) - The Dutch government on Friday collapsed after failing to reach a deal on restricting immigration, junior coalition partner Christian Union said, a move expected to trigger new elections in the fall.
""The four parties decided that they cannot reach an agreement on migration. Therefore they decided to end this government,"" party spokesman Tim Kuijsten said, confirming media reports that Prime Minister Mark Rutte would tender the resignation of his government.
The crisis was triggered by a push by Rutte's conservative VVD party to limit the flow of asylum seekers to the Netherlands, which split his four-party government coalition when two parties refused to support his proposals.
Tensions came to a head this week, when Rutte demanded support for a proposal to limit entrance for children of war refugees who are already in the Netherlands and to make families wait at least two years before they can be united.
This last proposal went too far for the small Christian Union and liberal D66, triggering a crisis.
""It's a sad day,"" Defence Minister Kajsa Ollongren said as she arrived for an emergency cabinet meeting called after the migration talks ended in a stalemate.
""We have talked for a long time, but we have failed to reach agreement.""
Rutte will hold a press conference after the cabinet meeting, his office said.
The Netherlands already has a one of Europe's toughest immigration policies but under the pressure of right-wing parties, Rutte had for months been trying to seek ways to further reduce the inflow of asylum seekers.
Asylum applications in the Netherlands jumped by a third last year to over 46,000, and the government has projected they could increase to more than 70,000 this year - topping the previous high of 2015.
This will again put a strain on the country's asylum facilities, where for months last year hundreds of refugees at a time were forced to sleep in the rough with little or no access to drinking water, sanitary facilities or health care.
Rutte last year said he felt ""ashamed"" of the problems, after humanitarian group Medecins sans Frontieres sent in a team to the Netherlands for the first time ever, to assist with migrants' medical needs at the centre for processing asylum requests.
He promised to improve conditions at the facilities, mainly by reducing the number of refugees that reach the Netherlands. But he failed to win the backing of coalition partners who felt his policies went too far.
Rutte, 56, is the longest-serving government leader in Dutch history and the most senior in the EU after Hungary's Viktor Orban. He is expected to lead his VVD party again at the next elections.
Rutte's current coalition, which came to power in January 2022, was his fourth consecutive administration since he became prime minister in October 2010.

Without water you die quickly. Go into the Australian desert unprepared and you can be dead in hours.
Australia doesn't have a lot of freshwater. Even the big cities in the temperate/sub-tropical regions like Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth have desalination plants. These cities are in ""green"" areas. The only places with abundant freshwater are north east Queensland (tropical seaside areas with a nice mountain range to dam) and the monsoon areas in the northern territory and far north of WA (Lake Argyle, The Kakadu).
North Queensland is decently settled, but suffers from Tropical Cyclones. It's also full of scary shit like Coastal Taipains, Cassowarys, crocodiles and the worst of all, rural Queenslanders.
Northern Territory and the areas around Kununurra in northern Western Australia are similarly full of scary things and cyclones plus you get the monsoon which means months of challenges moving around. Plus there are two seasons in that area: Fucking hot and dry and fucking hot and wet. Oh, and the tidal range is 7 metres (23 feet in freedumb units).
I am not saying you can't live in these areas, indigenous peoples did for millennia. That being said, there were still more of them on the coast than the desert.
In Western Australia, we built a dam on the Ord river for the purpose of agriculture and development, this reservoir became Lake Argyle. Second largest freshwater reservoir on the continent. It's huge (and yes, there are freshwater crocodiles in it). It spawned a town to service the dam and the agriculture to follow.
The town is called Kununurra and has a population of 5,300. Mean minimum temperature is 21c (71F) and mean high is 35c (95f) maximum high is 45c (111f). It's 3,000 km from the state capital Perth. It's 800km from Darwin. Unsurprisingly, if you grow up there and don't want to be a farmer or related you leave and don't come back.
Back in the mid 2010s the government formed an infrastructure fund to try and get development moving in these areas. Put $5 billion AUD into the fund. Four fifths of fuck all happened with the money (it didn't help that the government was dumb as fuck conservatives who blocked any renewables development with this money).

Now I don't care about Americans tbh but when their president is running around portraying Europe as some kind of hellhole I think its only fair we respond in kind.
Maybe we could set up some european commision staffed by twitter trolls that tweet these statistics to Trump each time he makes a bullshit, illinformed comment on our countries.

It serves the corporatist overlords that actually run our country. It floods our labor market. That in turns drives down the price of labor and creates armies of desperate people that are willing to work three shitty, minimum wage jobs just to get by.

You might reconsider that. It's one of the reasons our floor remains so low while cost of living keeps rising. It's a matter of supply and demand. When you have 100 jobs for 80 people, wages rise. When you have 100 jobs for 120 people, wages drop. Same goes with housing, same goes with everything people need. Prices rise as demand does.
We don't need to stop immigration, but we definitely need to keep it at a level that we can handle. If our population had grown by 20% instead of 50% over the last 50 years wages would be higher and housing prices would be lower.

Immigration is the only one that has reliably stuck, and Republicans have been harping on it since the 80s.
Democrats have, on multiple occasions, attempted to reach across the aisle to fix the problem and create an orderly, legal pathway to citizenship. Republicans have rebuffed them. Many of these proposals have gotten broad bipartisan support until the political spin doctors realized that their golden issue was about to be swiped out from under their noses.
Republican approaches to the border are largely theatrical productions. The Trump wall is a big, flashy object that has not, will not, and would not do much to actually curb illegal immigration. Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott shuffling migrants around the nation hasn't done much to help solve the problem. Republicans love to complain and complain about the issue, but never propose any actual solutions. There's a good reason for this - if the issue were solved, they'd be out of office. Their other policies are wildly unpopular, especially in the era of Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Paul Gosar, and Lauren Boebert essentially holding the House of Representatives hostage.
The reasons for the current migrant surge are pretty obvious, and have little to do with any US policy:
Unrest and upheavals in South American and Central American countries
Global warming causing warmer parts of the world (South and Central America) to have lower crop yields
Unrealized demand that was tamped down during COVID
None of these have much to do with US policy. We can't control the supply of people seeking to cross the border.
Finally, while you say that you love immigration, implicit in your post is the notion that illegal immigration is bad. However, the economists that birthed the Republican approach to immigration believed that immigration was good so long as it was illegal. Source.

-Reduce international students intake (maybe a max of 200k a year or something) and increase requirements to an IELTS level of 7.5 or higher. You will end up with a lot more diverse intake of students and students who have the intelligence to integrate into canada.
-Deny anyone ability to seek refugee status or govt relief or welfare programs on a work or student visa. If they cant sustain themselves here, send them back immediately.
-Eliminate TFW program for low skilled jobs.
-All immigration streams need a quota system of max of 10% of immigration from one country. If our goal is multiculturalism then lets be multicultural.
-Bring in a 3 year Construction worker Visa to Pr system to get workers to build housing.
-Strict ban on anyone coming on vistor visa to work in canada (the govt allows this in some cases lol)
-Ban parental PR system. Anyone's parents want to come to canada, get a 10 year super visa and pay for the health insurance.

They want to bring me (and my partner) over on a 482 visa once the travel situation gets better - I understand travel exemptions are possible for software engineers as that is an occupation on the PMSOL list, but apparently flight ticket prices etc. are still prohibitively steep...
Let's say I get the 482 visa for 2 years and then want to apply for PR. From what I understand the 190 skilled regional-nominated visa is probably the best bet. However, I have a feeling the points requirement would still be pretty high for NSW (thanks to Sydney)...is that something you can confirm?
As an aside, any idea regarding processing times for 482 visas for people on the PMSOL list atm? For the medium term stream, the IMMI website says 75% hear back within 5 months...is that accurate in your experience?

A 417 visa which is what I'm here on costs about $400 (apparently, it was less before). It's good for at least one year.
You can apply online. I got mine in less than 2 weeks.
If you want to stay longer, you can switch to another visa or extend it for a year if you meet certain conditions.
There is a 6 month limit on how long you can work for one employer (can be an issue)

1c65rhu,New 482 Visa Changes,2024-04-17T09:46:48.987Z,"The reason why 482 is going under drastic changes is because employers are misusing this visa a lot.
Imagine a position for senior software developer advertised on SEEK with low pay than current market, this position wont be taken up by any sane people onshore because of pay rate and working condition. The employer can show that job has been up for months with no one to hire, then they can move on to offshore candidate who will take up job with shit pay as working condition is better and pay rate is better compared to home country.
This has happened a lot to almost many of IT, accounting and engineering sector which collectively brings national wage down even though there is actually no skill shortage. Which is why JSA is including only those occupation who has actual shortage and needs 482 visa.
There are hardly any invite without experience in 190 except nursing, some states do need commitment otherwise it will ruin chances to citizenship, I do agree with last point which should be applied to both 189/190.",2024-04-17T09:59:04.766Z,0.0,neutral,-0.7564,negative,
1c65rhu,New 482 Visa Changes,2024-04-17T09:46:48.987Z,"Largely it's an excellent idea. The 482 has been pretty abused previously. It is straightforward for family owned companies to pick family from abroad to work for them. It has been exploited in many professions, IT as the prime example, to suppress wages by hiring immigrants on wages far below standard, and falsely claiming a role to be in shortage when in truth it isnt. A lot of the roles on there need culling, from 2 aspects too. Some, like hospitality management, is neither in shortage, nor warrants the need to hire abroad instead of locally, it's not skilled enough per se.
Secondly, and I really hope changes to the SOL for the 189/190/491 are updated after this too, a bunch of professions are listed which frankly stand no chance of success. Jobs which aren't in demand, and aren't getting invites. Heaps of cases of queries on this sub of people asking their chances for obscure profession X. Its exploitative to applicants paying for skills assessments that stand no chance, and it's good that can hopefully be largely stopped. If these jobs come back in need, add them back. When thinks aren't in need, remove them promptly.
Some of the changes are actually super beneficial to those on them. 6 months is a realistic timeframe to find new employment if some issue arises in sponsorship. 60 days currently is wishful thinking. There will apparently be much clearer routes to PR too.
You make great points about 190 especially and the 491, but I dont think they are abused near as much. Except medicine and nursing, pretty much all the 190 roles require X years experience. Similarly, for most skilled professions it's unlikely (but possible still) they will change from what they are skilled in. Wholeheartedly agree that rules to stay in a state for a period are a great idea.
Remains to be seen how the changes unfold, but overall seems a big step in the right direction. One likely to be popular in the eyes of the electorate too, as it will cut numbers, cut the BS or a good portion, and get in the jobs actually needed.",2024-04-17T14:15:47.919Z,0.0,neutral,0.9772,positive,

Immigration was sold to Canadians as helping improve affordability of life and quality of life as it would help fund social programs. It has put us in one of the deepest housing crisis we have ever known in this nation alongside a general affordability of life/quality of life crisis. How does this help our seniors and other vulnerable communities survive?
It doesn't. It took alienated and struggling demographics and completely divorced them from the system. Now we have record high food bank usage, shelters are full, and tent slums continue to grow every fucking month. Every single story now in Canada is about how hard it is to simply survive. If you don't come from generational wealth or have a safety housing net it is impacting peoples mental health to the point of break downs. We have rising rates of depression and anxiety year after year. Substance abuse keeps going up. These are not the signs of a mentally healthy society.
This doesn't even mention the ethnic, religious, and political conflicts we have imported to our streets.
My god have you seen the prices of bachelor suites and one bedroom apartments? The very basics of housing? We still can't get our corrupt city, provincial, and federal leaders to work together and with private sector to get mass medium and high density housing construction actually going to help us..
Immigration is massively abused for cheap exploitable labor and a larger consumer base for higher profits that a class that already has no problems got to enjoy all the fruits of. Sadly our political leaders from city, provincial, and federal levels are usually part of this class or buddy buddy with it and this is why it took them so long to even acknowledge the housing crisis existed despite how loud and how long the voices of pain and suffering were here in Canada.
The international student program is so bad for misuse and abuse of our food banks some food banks have stopped allowing this demographic to use their services. That and the need is too high. Maybe our standards are not correct for this program...? We also have the sickening videos and other things we all know about in regards to how to rip off these services and support systems floating around..
Temporary Foreign Worker Program - My god Justin and Singh talked about this themselves. Then in power they made it a million times worse. We already had one scandal here and this one is much much bigger. Funny how money and power corrupt..
Lastly the ""refugee"" and ""asylum"" pathways. My god we saw how these were exploited and scammed across the world. Did we decide to tighten our borders? Did we decide to plan ahead?
NOPE
Now we have this whole program massively scammed to high heavens and people that are not even Canadian citizens are filling our shelters, being put up in hotels, and making government spending at city, provincial, and federal level even higher.
I guess though as long as all of this profits the wealth class that involves politicians and private sector leaders it is all okay though right?
All the negative societal costs going on the middle class backs that are barely above water at this point.
We need to get back to common sense and basic math.
If you bring in vastly more people than you do housing development in a year that is going to cause issues around accessibility and affordability.
If that continues year after year that is going to lead to a crisis of accessibility and affordability of housing.

Damn, lots of mad Americans replied to my post! Too many to catch you all, so I'm editing for one and all.
First off, no I'm not anti-American, I'm anti-being lectured about covid by a country that completely botched their covid response.
Second, the thing about having a totalitarian dictatorship in Australia is that this is a fabrication by right wing media for the consumption of low IQ gullible twats. Here's the real story that Fox news doesn't want you to know:
- Part of the country has had lockdowns for part of the pandemic in order to prevent our hospital systems being overwhelmed.
- Many if not most Western nations also had lockdowns, Australia is nothing special in this regard.
- The reason that we were having lockdowns after all the other countries that also had lockdowns cancelled their lockdowns is because our Federal government failed to roll out the vaccines on schedule. Back in June 2021 when Delta struck Australia just about everyone in the US and UK had been vaccinated if they wanted and we were at something like 10% vaccinations.
- Now we're hitting our vaccination targets, our two most populous states, NSW and Victoria, have opened back up.
That's it, that's the whole story. Lockdowns like everyone else that had lockdowns, but later on because of an incompetent Federal government. Lockdowns that either have now ended or were never imposed beyond a few days for the majority of the Australian population.
Stop being hysterical Americans, there is literally nothing to see here...except of course a lesson in how to manage pandemics.

Damn, lots of mad Americans replied to my post! Too many to catch you all, so I'm editing for one and all.
First off, no I'm not anti-American, I'm anti-being lectured about covid by a country that completely botched their covid response.
Second, the thing about having a totalitarian dictatorship in Australia is that this is a fabrication by right wing media for the consumption of low IQ gullible twats. Here's the real story that Fox news doesn't want you to know:
- Part of the country has had lockdowns for part of the pandemic in order to prevent our hospital systems being overwhelmed.
- Many if not most Western nations also had lockdowns, Australia is nothing special in this regard.
- The reason that we were having lockdowns after all the other countries that also had lockdowns cancelled their lockdowns is because our Federal government failed to roll out the vaccines on schedule. Back in June 2021 when Delta struck Australia just about everyone in the US and UK had been vaccinated if they wanted and we were at something like 10% vaccinations.
- Now we're hitting our vaccination targets, our two most populous states, NSW and Victoria, have opened back up.
That's it, that's the whole story. Lockdowns like everyone else that had lockdowns, but later on because of an incompetent Federal government. Lockdowns that either have now ended or were never imposed beyond a few days for the majority of the Australian population.
Stop being hysterical Americans, there is literally nothing to see here...except of course a lesson in how to manage pandemics.

The trouble is, very few migrants arriving in Australia come with the skills to build the extra homes we need.

As a Canadian, I personally went through OzTREKK, an agency that specializes in helping Canadian and American students apply to programs (eg. Medicine) in Australia and New Zeeland. You can schedule a call with them and they will essentially take you through the entire process, even going through your transcript and telling you which universitates you are competitive for. They also will handle all your applications on your behalf, and work with you through the entire process at no cost.
I think given your particular situation, they might also give you advice on how proceed as an international student studying in the US and what resources are available for you. I will also mention that you do not need to sit the GAMSAT (unless you need to for a personal reason), all Canadian and American internationals applying to postgraduate medical programs in Australia are assessed based on GPA and MCAT (Here is a table for the 2024 GPA 4.0 scale and MCAT requirements from OzTREKK)

13pupkh,Australian PhD Funding for International Students,2023-05-23T17:18:12.959Z,"Funding here is done via scholarship. Most students are on an RTP scholarship which is run federally, and covers the cost of tuition and provides a stipend. These are competitive, and I believe there are less available for international students.
Alternatively, all universities will have internal scholarships that they offer also. Here's a link to Melb Uni's (don't call it U Melbourne - they won't like that haha!!) scholarships page so you can get a feel for what might be available: https://scholarships.unimelb.edu.au/

12o3f7v,Which English test is best for post study work visa?,2023-04-16T10:01:33.345Z,"For Visa 485 (post study work visa) the English language requirement is as follows:
- IELTS: Overall score of at least 6 with a minimum score of 5 for each of the 4 parts (Reading, Listening, Writing, Speaking)
- PTE: Overall score of at least 50 with a minimum score of 36 for each of the 4 parts.
You should already have a language test result that you used for your Australian study. Check the expiry date for that one, you might not have to seat for one again. The result is usually valid for 3 years.
IELTS and PTE are the primary tests everyone prefers. PTE is relatively easier, but for the requirements of this visa, both are easy to get the desired score. Both tests have an academic and a general version. For Australia, only PTE Academic is available, which costs $385*. The price may vary a little depending on which organisation you're registering with. You can seat for IELTS general training (academic one is harder, not needed for 485). IELTS General Training costs $395*. Again, this might vary a little depending on which organisation you're registering with. By registration organisation, I mean, there are multiple organisations that arrange the tests on behalf of Pearson (PTE) or British Council (IELTS). You'll see the list when you're booking and can choose the nearest test centre to you. Best of luck!

I loved the experience of studying overseas! So that's something you should factor in - will you enjoy the course and your life outside the classroom more at UTS than on another similar program (in your country or in another country)?
The other questions I would be asking is how you think this degree will be received when you return home and what the job market is like where you're from. Remember that a behavioural economics degree could lead down a few paths (behavioural eco, yes, but also market research and insights work, policy work, more eco or finance work and probably other things) - so you can think about what associated things you might be interested in persuing and look at the markets for those as well.
It's really great that you have identified a couple of things you know you are less interested in! My advice would be to avoid those - if behavioural economics is what you're most interested in then at least this master's will be more interesting and fun for you than any other masters. And then at the end you will be on track to work somewhere more aligned with that. Clinical psych is a tough grind - I definitely don't think you would want to do that unless you're super into it.
(Note that the whole ""follow your passions"" advice is contingent on a certain amount of financial and other types of security so make the call that's right for you!)
Finally, I don't know anything about working without a visa in the BI industry - apologies.

With that context: you're going at this backwards. First you need to figure out what career makes sense for your life, considering your aptitudes, interests, national (for you) and global trends, and only then figure out how to get there.
A degree without a plan and goal is a waste of time and money.
About this specific degree, my opinion is that it's highly unlikely to increase your career prospects, because no one is clamoring to hire Economics Masters degree holders, and because BE as a field has had some reputational setbacks recently. But this last paragraph doesn't matter - before starting any other degree, first you need to have a goal in mind.

With that context: you're going at this backwards. First you need to figure out what career makes sense for your life, considering your aptitudes, interests, national (for you) and global trends, and only then figure out how to get there.
A degree without a plan and goal is a waste of time and money.
About this specific degree, my opinion is that it's highly unlikely to increase your career prospects, because no one is clamoring to hire Economics Masters degree holders, and because BE as a field has had some reputational setbacks recently. But this last paragraph doesn't matter - before starting any other degree, first you need to have a goal in mind.
For general career advice, there are probably more helpful subreddits to ask your question.

1btitn6,Working visa experiences in Australia?,2024-04-01T23:06:20.485Z,"You've got a year long visa so you'll probably want to move around. But a lot depends on how much you're planning on working and what your skills are. There's also the question of if you are going to try and get your 88 days to extend your visa for another year.
If you're not worried about extending your visa and you don't mind working hospitality stuff then a big city is a good place to start. But keep in mind that the Australian rental market is pretty absurd right now so finding a flat can be quite difficult (or so I've been told).
If you want to extend your visa you basically have to go somewhere rural. It's also a good option to save money since some jobs will offer room and board if you commit to a period of time. But you might end up in a working hostel to do your days/save some money and that experience can really depend on your personality. I personally loved it, but I also know people who went home/gave up after a few weeks.
As a side note pay is very similar wherever you are in Australia, most jobs that are available to backpackers will be casual positions based on what are called ""award rates"" which are basically industry wide contracts that lay out pay, breaks, overtime, etc..",2024-04-02T00:18:17.092Z,0.0,neutral,0.9873,positive,visa experiences

This is similar scenario for malaysia where locals would not want to work lower paying job like constructions, etc. Its all depends on how long is the visa. Employers would not want to hire anyone which have 3 months work visa. For those having 12 months visa, you may find some contract work. It is not common and hard to get in but it is worth a try.
Normally, you apply the visa first. Then apply for the job. its a gamble whether you will find a job that you want. Work sponsorship is all depends on the company whether they want to extend your WHV to Work Visa.",2024-03-19T19:16:00.996Z,0.4019,positive,0.5514,positive,
