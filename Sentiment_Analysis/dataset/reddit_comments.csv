4,1cwjvlj,Complete-Bat2259,"It’s all spelled out on the very page you linked.
“In the 6 months before you apply for this visa, you must have met the Australian study requirement. You will meet this if you have been awarded at least one degree, diploma or trade qualification and:
your course was a CRICOS-registered course
you successfully completed all course requirements
your study was in English
you completed your course as a result of at least two academic years (92) weeks study
you completed your course in Australia in not less than 16 calendar months
you held an Australian visa that allowed you to study.”
And
“We will only process your visa application if:
you are the main holder of a current Student visa (but not one supported by the Defence or Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister)
you held a Student visa within the past 6 months before your application and you now have a Bridging Visa A or Bridging Visa B, granted on the basis of a valid application for a visa
you held a Student visa within the past 6 months before your application and you now hold a substantive visa
you are inside Australia and you hold or have held an eligible Student visa (but not one supported by the Defence or Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister).”

6,1cwjvlj,Character_Eggplant67,"To break it down and put this in simple terms, you should apply for the 485 visa after your course completion date and not after your current dates of Ur COE nor your student visa.
What I would recommend is to start your application once you have the transcripts for your degree. As to why they want you to be in Australia during the application is because of a few reasons:
Immigration policy: The 485 visa is designed for international students who have completed their studies in Australia and want to gain work experience or extend their stay in the country. By requiring applicants to be in Australia, the government ensures that they have already demonstrated a commitment to studying and living in the country.
Visa integrity: This requirement helps maintain the integrity of the visa program by reducing the risk of fraudulent applications or individuals attempting to bypass visa requirements.
Assessing eligibility: Being in Australia allows the government to verify an applicant's identity, academic qualifications, and work experience more easily, ensuring they meet the necessary eligibility criteria.
Streamlined processing: By being in Australia, applicants can provide biometric data and attend an interview if required, making the application process more efficient.
Integration and settlement: The government encourages international students to stay in Australia and contribute to the economy and society. By requiring them to be in the country, they can start building connections, finding employment, and integrating into the community.
Plus at the date of your submitted 485 visa, you would be issued with a bridging visa A and it kinda extents your stay further in Australia. So why not :) hope this helps!",2024-05-20T22:14:10.609Z

I would say focus on gaining skills for now, that is the only option we have. Make sure that you have an edge in the labour market. Nevertheless, they will bring a new visa, Skills in Demand, this will really be beneficial to critical sectors, and I believe IT is one of them.
So don't stress much, focus on what you have at hand right now.

60,1dlijni,BitSec_,"The 485 requires the Police Check to be requested before the day the application is lodged. This means if you plan to apply on Jun 14th you need to apply for the Police Check on June 13th. This is something your migration agent 100% should have known, this is common knowledge and not a ""new"" requirement.
Unfortunately for you I have researched a bunch of AAT appeals and it seems that all of them are decided by one thing: ""cl 485.213 required the applicant to have applied for the AFP check during the 12 months immediately before the day of their visa application and for evidence of this to have accompanied their application."" and also in most cases the applicant have to pay the first respondents some fixed costs. So I think your chances of winning are low.
And to answer your other question about, ""why do they want the pc to be submitted 24 hours earlier? What’s the diff?"". This is just a requirement from the Department of Home Affairs and whatever reasoning it has there's probably a good reason for it. One I can think of is to streamline the application process or to help with automation. You have to realize that all skilled and family visa's combined made up for 250K applications while there were 590K student visa applications. So if there is some way to speed up the process for them by having this requirement then it's worth having. Altough I agree that they could make it a little bit more clear for the applicant.

However I did hear anecdotal stories about this ""receipt"" thing where some people got free pass and some, well, ended up like you.
I believed there are two things you must do:
Hire another migration lawyer (a good one preferably) to represent you before the AAT should you decide to pursuit this venue. Best discuss with them about your chances of winning and how to best prepare for the trial.
Before you made the complaint to OMARA, ensure that you followed their guides to complain here: Before you make a complaint (mara.gov.au). However they will not be able to get your money back as you would have to go through with the Civil Court in your State for civil matter (in this case that would be a Breach of Contract from the agent side).
Best of luck but for the love of God please ensure ALL documents are present and valid at the time of submitting any visa application to save yourself all these hassles. Say you were properly misled by your MARA agent and able to overturn DHA's decision at the AAT, that would be months of waiting and thousands of dollars wasted just because you couldn't complete a $47 AFP Police Check before submission.
Also NEVER EVER trust your MARA agent 100%. Always double check everything.

We may ask you to provide a police certificate (also called a penal clearance certificate) from every country you lived in. If we ask you for one, it will usually be if you are over 17 and lived in any of the listed countries, including Australia, for at least 12 months in the past 10 years.

There's a new points system that will be implemented in July 2025 or 2026, and the professional year will likely not be counted in the new system. I think DHA will annouce the full details later this year. If you can get a full-time job, the professional year might not be worth it, but it still provides you a guaranteed ACS skill assessment.
I think it's better lodge you EOI as soon as you get the skill assessment which will take you at least a year if you don't have any experience.

272,1bbl0dt,Iwantcheap,"LONG POST BUT PLS SHOW THIS AS A REFERENCE TO ANY FAMILY MEMBERS OR FRIENDS SO OTHER AUSTRALIANS DONT HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT UNJUSTIFIED WHINGING ABOUT THE TOURISM VISA PROCESS WHICH IS EASY LOL
I’m an Australian (born and raised) who once occupied an Australian government job similar to this and ALSO married a man born and raised in India (hey I live in India now!!) hopefully this reply can help others.
Precursor; Australians (especially Melbournians and Sydney siders) actually prefer Indian tourists to other foreigners. The Chinese are in their own bubble, the Russians are snobby, Europeans tend to remain invisible. But Indians come, spend money by going out, are often quite friendly and polite (as they’re having a great time!!) and tend to have a better attitude. However the entitled, loud, rude and mannerless Indians who do come to Sydney (in their minorities) are the ones who complain of racism (don’t get me wrong that does exist) but it’s just their lack of bloody manners which gets them treated like crap. And ANYONE in Australia with shit manners will get treated like this. You cannot go there as a tourist and complain, whinge and complain about the rules if you don’t get your way. A big no no.
Firstly you don’t get special treatment by your Indian peers just for being Indian.
Secondly, your visa was fairly rejected in the first instance. BUT, on the second time you MAYBE would have gotten approved but I think the assessing agent had valid reasons to reject it (more on that below). And I can tell you from experience that sometimes it is because of the officer looking at your application.
When I got married in Sydney and had people from India apply to come attend my wedding, I had friends in college in India with no income have their visas approved and approved QUICKLY. I had aunts with jobs studying phds have their visas rejected (but they were older and had families). I had friends earning crores have their visa come very very late.
I think what has held you back is the fact that you listed your sisters’ medical situation (as tough as it is) as a primary reason of visit. In the agents head; they might reason that if her health declines further, you might overstay your tourist visa and argue that you need to stay here longer (it happens more often than you think).
With your tourist visa, if you had just applied and said you want to visit your family, see the sights of Sydney, explore Australia, you might have had a better chance. It also helps providing an itinerary (as I had my friends who applied from India do) listing which tourism sights you planned to see.
Also I would recommend you booking a hotel and providing those references for the duration of your stay in support of your application. You can always cancel these prior as well. The agent knows you’re visiting Sydney solely for her health situation, thinking you’re going to be staying with her, who is to say you won’t overstay your visa and get an illegal job whilst staying at her house and continuing to support her? We know you won’t, but they’re judging on what they’re seeing in front of them and what they’ve seen happen THERE.
The other reason you may have gotten rejected;
To the assessing agent, your application looks valid, has good supporting evidence, but it doesn’t meet their criteria of a TOURISM VISA. It’s like you’re being asked to provide information on horses, BUT you have written exemplary information on TIGERS. Your information is correct but bro either apply for the tigers application or talk about the damn horse. No one sitting in Sydney is thinking you’re making shit up.
Australian bureaucracy is simpler than what people think. Satisfy the criteria, provide the required evidence and no one will question you. Show your income, letter of approval from your work, letter of invitation, but state that the primary reason is for TOURISM. To have a short recreational stay.
I would reapply in a while, as the previous records of application and rejection will still come up. If you reapply quickly, they’re going go to continue to think that you’re there in Sydney for a long time to support your family with very less incentive to go back. Still mention your sisters health (as you’ve officially mentioned it twice on your visa applications now) but also overstate your intention to travel. Also very firmly and clearly overstate your NEED to come back to India to continue your employment as you have a contract etc etc. you have to also explicitly state you have no intention of wanting to work or live in Australia, that you just want to visit recreationally as a tourist.
THIS IS WHY WE HAVE DIFFERENT STREAMS PEOPLE. why are you applying for a tourist visa and overstating your sisters illness?? CMON BRO WORK WITH ME HERE 🤣
Also as a very proud Australian, we are VERY proud of our rules and strict regulations. It’s what keeps our country fair, operational and free from corruption. Respect the rules and don’t whinge about them unnecessarily because you didn’t get what you wanted. Drop the entitlement, as I’ve stated prior, I’ve had friends be granted tourism visas (three years with unlimited entry) by doing the process correctly. Sometimes you do get an up the arse agent but As we Aussies say; ‘tough titties love’.
Hope this helped a little.
P.S: now I’m not generalising, but even with my husbands family, I’ve noticed that when it comes to beurocratic processes of other countries, it’s always ‘OH ITS CANADAS FAULT ITS A SHIT COUNTRY BLA VLA BLA’. When a quick google search will show you the clearly correct procedures to do something to avoid heart break.
Let’s not start criticising and making things like this about other shit just because you didn’t follow the rules properly. Also why the hell you booking flights and going to the airport without no damn visa? I apply for all my husbands visa (Indian passport) and we wait until we get that approval. That is what it is unfortunately and it is a hassle I understand. :(
In OP’s defence; there are NRI Indians who do have a stick up their arse in letting in fellow Indians. I’m diaspora Indian (born and raised in Sydney with parents who have been born and raised in a country outside of India for three generations but still Indian) and I’ve definitely worked with Indians who have just become citizens of are trying to. And my god do they act like they don’t know shit about India and do look down on them. Like for what? It’s so fucking embarrassing as an Indian diaspora kid who is proud of her roots. Their behaviour clearly panders to white supremacy here which is what the POC community is trying to ERADICATE.
And I’ll be so honest, with the cost of living and housing crisis in Sydney, I can bet you that the immigrant Indians I worked with at state level in the APS, they definitely would not be able to have the same level of savings of OP. And often these NRI folk get like envious and try to justify their move to Australia by putting down India, just to make themselves feel better about living in Sydney and trying to keep up with inflation and the cost of living crisis",2024-03-11T03:13:48.916Z

This is straight out from the new document: “Where a graduate is working in a skilled job in the labour market, the graduate will be able to apply for the new Skills in Demand visa or a permanent skilled visa, rather than requiring a two-year extension based on their qualification. This brings Australia's graduates visa settings into line with most comparable countries.

i.e. if you dropped out of the Masters tomorrow, could you be awarded the bachelors, without having to re-enrolling and transfer credits?
The 485 visa requires you to meet the Australian Study Requirement, which in turn requires the applicant to have ""completed"" the ""degree"". The definition of both terms are found in legislation and crucial in terms of answering your question.

You can apply for the Post Study Work Stream if your course is CRICOS-Registered, you might be able to find this in your university handbook for your degree.
I applied for my 485 on my own and had no issues, just need to get your documents ready. Look up what you need and lodge your application soon. Don't panic though, as soon as you apply for it, you will be issued a bridging visa and you will be able to stay legally until your 485 is processed.
Then monitor your email and your immi online account for any updates on what you need, ie. Health Examination and the like.

The Australian Study Requirement for the Temporary Graduate visa (Subclass 485) – Post-Study Work Stream has specific conditions that must be met. Here are the key points relevant to your situation:
1. Two Academic Years (92 Weeks) Study Requirement:
• The Australian study requirement mandates that you must complete a course or courses that total at least two academic years (92 weeks) of study.
• This requirement is generally interpreted as needing to have been enrolled in the course(s) for a total of at least 92 weeks of actual academic study.
2. Overlap of Qualifications:
• If you complete more than one qualification and use only the most recent qualification to meet the Australian study requirement, any credit received in the most recent qualification from the previous qualification counts towards meeting the requirement.
• Additionally, the actual period of study within the previous qualification can also be used to meet the 16-month study requirement.
Given your scenario:
• You completed a Bachelor of IT and then enrolled in a Master of IT at the same university.
• Your Master’s program is reduced to 1.5 years (72 weeks) due to the 48 credit points you received from your Bachelor’s program.
• The total duration for the Master’s course (according to the CoE) is 16 months and 4 days.
Evaluating Your Eligibility:
1. Total Duration of Study:
• The Master’s program duration (16 months and 4 days as per your CoE) satisfies the 16-month requirement.
2. Two Academic Years (92 Weeks) Study:
• The 48 credit points from your Bachelor’s degree that reduced your Master’s study duration can be counted towards the 92-week requirement.
• To ensure you meet the 92 weeks requirement, the combined study period of your Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees should be considered.
Conclusion:
Based on your information:
• Your Master’s degree duration (including credit points from your Bachelor’s) effectively contributes towards the 92-week requirement.
• Your Statement of Completion indicates a total duration exceeding 16 months, which meets the required timeframe.
Given these factors, you likely meet the Australian Study Requirement for the Subclass 485 visa under the Post-Study Work Stream. However, visa applications can be complex, and interpretation of the requirements can vary. It would be prudent to consult with a registered migration agent or the Department of Home Affairs to confirm your eligibility and to ensure all documentation is correctly presented to support your case.",2024-05-25T16:50:20.637Z
476,1d0c2dt,RedWyvv,"Update for future readers:
I recently met with an immigration lawyer who assured me that there shouldn't be any issues with my application. She advised me to include documentation for both my bachelor and master programs. Additionally, she recommended that I write a letter explaining my situation clearly, so the immigration officer has all the necessary information without having to make any assumptions, and attach this letter with my application.
When there are multiple courses:
The Australian study requirement does not require visa applicants to have completed a single course of study of 2 academic years’ duration. Applicants may use study undertaken to complete more than one ~degree~, ~diploma~ or ~trade qualification~ to meet the Australian study requirement.
The courses of study need not have been undertaken within a 24 month period. It is possible to have a break between completing the first course and commencing the second.",2024-05-27T01:49:07.593Z

Worked silly rubbish jobs for fun as I lived off the loan. Call centres, Phone book delivery, bar work and even a porn shop (a porn/pet shop!) Companies were throwing sponsorships offers at us as they didn’t have the workers and wanted us to stay.
Not sure I would recommend it now? It would set any back 18 months from a career in the UK and from what I hear, sponsorships are as rare as hens teeth unless you have certain skills? The cost of living is WAY higher than the $3 to a £1 I was getting which means you are working harder to maintain a decent standard.

Depending on the gap you could try to extend the processing of the student visa to try and stay on bridging visas until the 485 which may give her better work rights.

Try to reach out to the department, either through their call center or by uploading a letter in both of your student and 485 visa application. I have heard of cases where they have simply reversed the grant moving you back to original visa.
in all your dealings, completely own up to your mistake and donot try to blame the department. You insinuating that they should not have granted you 485 is wrong, you should have your withdrawn student visas but it is fixable.

This has always been one of my arguments for going with a Partner Visa despite the skilled visa's being cheaper and potentially take less time. You can't predict the future and you can't predict what sort of stunts the government is going to do next with temporary visa's.
With a Partner Visa you will get some more peace and can start thinking about saving up for a down deposit on a house. If your partner is earning more than you you might even be able to buy a house quicker than you think. After all the government is less likely to suddenly change the policy regarding Partner Visa's because it only makes up a very small amount of the immigration numbers.
I came to Australia in 2022 and applied for a Partner Visa in 2023. I still have about 6-8 months to wait until I can apply for the 801 partner visa (permanent) and then however long the grant takes which could be up to a year.

Full text: Hey everyone! Just graduated from UQ with a degree in microbiology and immunology. Recently applied for the 485 Graduate visa under the post-study stream, and included my partner in the application as well.
Applied for the visa on December 17, 2023, and it's been 2 months and 2 weeks since then. Finally received my health examination requirements on February 27th and promptly got them done the next day. Submitted all necessary documents, possibly even twice for a couple of them because I wasn't sure if I did.
I know my visa application is still within the standard processing timeframe, but I'm feeling quite nervous, especially after hearing that some folks in forums got their 485 visas almost instantly.
Anyone else in a similar situation? Also, if they requested my health examinations months after my submission, does that mean that my visa might be finalized soon?
Thanks guys. I appreciate it.

844,199xpof,BitSec_,"So while I'm not an expert on these student visa's I still like to comment to maybe help you in the right direction.
If you want to join your boyfriend on his student visa you will need to be added as a secondary applicant to a student visa application. The immi website says the following about bringing family like kids, spouse or partner:
You must declare your family members in your student visa application even if they do not plan to travel with you to Australia. If you do not do this, your family members will not be eligible for a student visa to join you in Australia.
Now in Australia you can only hold one visa at a time. If you hold a visa and you apply for another visa then the last granted visa will be the visa registered to you. The old visa will cease to exists.
From the immi website I would believe that if you are on your Temporary Activity visa and your boyfriend would apply for the student visa with you as the secondary applicant you can still do your research, go back to The Netherlands and later apply for the student visa / subsequent entrant visa to join your boyfriend back in Australia.
Altough I'm not quite sure if this is how it works if you're a secondary applicant or if you will get a similar visa to a student visa once your boyfriend gets his granted. Either way the student visa would have more rights than the temporary activity visa. I'd still recommend chatting with a migration agent about this, sometimes they offer free consultation, or at most you'll have to pay €100 or AUD 165 for some advice regarding this.
I hope this helps getting you in the right direction and good luck with your visa, study and PhD!",2024-01-19T04:49:12.806Z

It’s highly unlikely you’ll need any evidence of English for the visa. Being from Germany it’s not required at the time of lodgement.
However, the university will require evidence of English to meet their entry requirements. Usually this means either the completion of any certificate iv (or above) from Australia, an IELTS / PTE equivalent, or some universities will have an internal placement test or LLN test you can take.
Call their international admissions department and confirm if they have a placement test. If they don’t, you may need an IELTS.",2023-09-12T11:10:58.160Z

Full text: Mine is a student visa & also a couple case (as in I’m travelling with my wife). My idiot agent mistakenly filed the draft form with the details for my 3 previous employers filled in rough (he put random info in there). Now, after he submitted the forms, I immediately noticed the mistake and filed the Notice of Incorrect answers with the correct details online & also uploaded a physical signed copy with the details within 8 hours of forms submission. All this happened this Friday. But I’m now worried that they might reject my visa considering the general high alert due to fake student visas and my case was in their radar considering my spouse case. What should I do? Is there any way I can clarify further? Should I be really this worried? My intake is in july. I have paid AUD 1257. I would struggle to afford to apply again. Any insight would be really helpful.

Surely when they finish their course, they should return to their own country. If they really want to live and work in Australia, they can then apply for migrant entry, like anyone else. There qualifications and previous experience of Australia will stand them in good stead in their application. And anyone with a family member at university has heard many stories about how courses have been dumbed down, requirements loosened, and language standards go out the window, just to accommodate international students whose performance is below par, but whose dollars are indispensable. We are lowering quality by relying of international students.”
And this is really, really sad. Currently Australia operates on some bizarre scheme where many Chinese students come to Australia because they couldn't enroll in American or British university and their parents want to brag about their educated child and pass them their business once they got their degree from Western country. So they return to their country later and they hold really good degrees from Aussie universities but they don't plan to work in Australia or contribute to the country because the degree was just a pass to be a prospective and educated citizen back home. And then we have countries from East Asia like India where many come in to do VET courses just to stay, work 60 hours per week and send money back home whilst doing some bullshit courses in ghost colleges. And at the end we have local people who are trying to also study in American or British universities just to get out because cost of living here is so damn high and on the international scene Aussie universities are not that much respected when it comes to highly advanced subjects. Top educators and institutions know that Aussie universities often being used as second choice for those that couldn't enroll to US or UK. So we end up in a situation when we are having people hopping on visas and extending their stay artificially just to maybe get some luck and get invited for a 189 or 190 or nominated by employer and employers are craving for specialized employees. But those employees rather want to go to US where their salary is going to be much bigger.

SYDNEY, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Australia on Monday said it would tighten visa rules for international students and low-skilled workers that could halve its migrant intake over the next two years as the government looks to overhaul what it said was a ""broken"" migration system.
The decision comes after net immigration was expected to have peaked at a record 510,000 in 2022-23. Official data showed it was forecast to fall to about a quarter of a million in 2024-25 and 2025-26, roughly in line with pre-COVID levels.
""We've worked around the clock to strike the best balance in Australia's migration system,"" Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said in a statement ahead of the formal release of the government's new migration strategy later on Monday.
""The government's targeted reforms are already putting downward pressure on net overseas migration, and will further contribute to this expected decline,"" O'Neil said.
O'Neil said the increase in net overseas migration in 2022-23 was mostly driven by international students.
Australia boosted its annual migration numbers last year to help key businesses recruit staff to fill shortages after the COVID-19 pandemic brought tighter border controls, and kept foreign students and workers out of the country for nearly two years.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese over the weekend said Australia's migration numbers needed to be wound back to a ""sustainable level,"" adding that ""the system is broken.""
Long reliant on immigration to supply what is now one of the tightest labour markets in the world, Australia's Labor government has pushed to speed up the entry of highly skilled workers and smooth their path to permanent residency.
Under the new policies, international students would need higher ratings on English tests. It will also end settings that allowed students to prolong their stay in Australia.
A new specialist visa for highly skilled workers will be set up with the processing time cut to one week, helping businesses recruit top migrants amid tough competition with other developed economies.

Processing time for Postgrad research sector is high, but it does not really reflect the current processing speed.

https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/news-media/archive/article?itemId=1155
So I guess it is possible that you will receive your visa within Jan but it depends greatly on your application. Luckily, applications from fully funded Ph.D. candidates are considered strong ones and have a higher rate of success.

Tourist trip to Japan from Australia before 1 year student visa.
Hi there,
I hope this is the right subreddit for this. I am going to Japan next year from April on a student Visa, but was hoping to go over on a quick 1 week trip later this year to re-acquaint myself with Tokyo before settling there. Will there be any implications on my application for a Student visa because of this? Australia has a visa waiver agreement with Japan so I can't imagine there would be but I wouldn't want to jeopardise my student visa.
Thanks in advance!

1196,1cbmghz,Extension-Active4025,"Given the political climate this was inevitable. Government wants to cut numbers, needs to, as would the opposition if they got in. General public perceptions towards immigration isn't good and only getting worse, exacerbated by a housing crisis.
To achieve this, the high risk nationalities were always destined to cop the worst of it. They are more likely to want to stay after, they are more likely to bring family, and due to terrible wages/standards back home they are more likely to select easy, trivial courses to A) get in and B) be able to maximise working. Negative stereotypical connotations about these nationalities doing this means the change will likely be looked upon very favourably by and large.
Ironically despite a lot of back and forth arguments on the implications, the government could really win on all fronts on this. They are seen as taking decisive actions to reduce numbers and target fraudulent applications. Whilst unis are propped up largely on a lucrative international market, demand is so high at present, especially from the listed countries that they can really start cutting numbers and increasing rejections to whatever level they choose to balance keeping that international cash flow. Hopefully it can really start to weed out those fraudulent applications so the genuine students are arriving. One of the real travesties about visas is how a small minority of fraudulent applicants from these countries make it so much harder for their countrymen that are genuine.
Good on Germany for being proactive on filling their shortages (in theory no different to what the skilled visas are doing here). Not sure how quickly or effectively Indians will transition from speaking English, which is currently taught, to German. Or how long the good times there will last.

What will happen is when you get approved for a tourist visa for some reason your student visa application will be placed on hold and you’ll have to perform some ridiculous gymnastics to get it processed again. This happened to me when I was waiting for my skill shortage visa.
What you’ll need is a bridging visa A/B (can’t remember which) which technically allows you to be present in the country while awaiting for your visa.

All the best my friend - you’ll get it eventually - but I don’t recommend complicating your application by entering AU with anything else but your student visa. Be advised that immigration is aware of whether you’re onshore / offshore, and this can affect the way your visa is processed - better to miss a week or two of classes (which an email to the uni can resolve) than cooking up something unsavoury with immigration - which can eventually affect your long-term migration plans.",2024-02-03T16:01:19.350Z

Cousins are usually not able to do this, unless there are very specific circumstances involved.

It's fine as long as the course is registered on CRICOS but the visa duration will be set in line with the course, usually 1 month longer than your COE to give you time to pack up and leave after you have finished your study. If you are studying a course that's not a Bachelor or higher, the Department of Home Affairs will also take into account the availability of such a course in your home country when deciding whether or not to grant you a visa, so for example if you're from the USA (for example) and applying for a student visa for a certificate of cookery or whatever, you will have some challenging questions posed to you about why you would want to spend an absolute fortune doing such a basic course in Australia when every community college in America could provide it to you for less.
If Im being completely honest, studying is secondary to the experience of living and working in Australia.
Study is the priority of a student visa. Coming to Australia on a student visa for the purpose of engaging in work is a breach of visa conditions and your visa will be refused or cancelled if the government gets even a whiff of what you are up to.
Enrolling in a research based Masters means you have no limit on your work rights, but other student visa holders are capped at 48 hours per fortnight which you may recognise is absolutely nothing and will probably not be enough to support yourself long term, which is why student visa applications need you to demonstrate you can already financially support yourself before you arrive.
Look into the subclass 189, subclass 190 and subclass 491 instead. These are work visas that do not require employer sponsorship (you are nominated and invited to apply by Australia's federal government or one of our state governments).",2023-03-25T02:49:23.917Z

China also signed a 30-day mutual visa exemption agreement with Singapore and a similar arrangement with Thailand, effective March 1, allowing visa-free visits of up to 30 days per entry. It has also eased visa requirements for U.S. citizens visiting the country on tourist visas, removing the need to provide proof of round-trip air tickets, hotel reservations, itineraries, or invitation letters.

Same with my bestfriend, she's coming to visit me by Dec. I think it was the US visa that made things a lot easier.

1342,1cbmghz,explosivekyushu,"There's a line from a great movie called The Usual Suspects where one of the main characters says ""The greatest trick the Devil ever played was convincing the world he didn't exist"". I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I reckon his second greatest trick was convincing the world Australia has an IT shortage. The market is completely and utterly flooded to bursting point. IT degrees are the new accounting degrees. You'll never find work, but the government policy hasn't caught up yet.",2024-04-24T03:29:06.318Z
1343,1cbmghz,Extension-Active4025,"Given the political climate this was inevitable. Government wants to cut numbers, needs to, as would the opposition if they got in. General public perceptions towards immigration isn't good and only getting worse, exacerbated by a housing crisis.
To achieve this, the high risk nationalities were always destined to cop the worst of it. They are more likely to want to stay after, they are more likely to bring family, and due to terrible wages/standards back home they are more likely to select easy, trivial courses to A) get in and B) be able to maximise working. Negative stereotypical connotations about these nationalities doing this means the change will likely be looked upon very favourably by and large.
Ironically despite a lot of back and forth arguments on the implications, the government could really win on all fronts on this. They are seen as taking decisive actions to reduce numbers and target fraudulent applications. Whilst unis are propped up largely on a lucrative international market, demand is so high at present, especially from the listed countries that they can really start cutting numbers and increasing rejections to whatever level they choose to balance keeping that international cash flow. Hopefully it can really start to weed out those fraudulent applications so the genuine students are arriving. One of the real travesties about visas is how a small minority of fraudulent applicants from these countries make it so much harder for their countrymen that are genuine.
Good on Germany for being proactive on filling their shortages (in theory no different to what the skilled visas are doing here). Not sure how quickly or effectively Indians will transition from speaking English, which is currently taught, to German. Or how long the good times there will last. As with all developed countries, attitudes and actions towards immigration changes frequently.",2024-04-24T03:13:53.342Z

Studying in Singapore isn’t necessarily relevant, they look at your nationality, and unfortunately India is a high risk country.
You can reapply but it will be harder as you’ll now need to prove even more given you have a declined visa application.
You say you must be back in Singapore but have a visa expiring in August, that’ll likely be a red flag to DHA as you don’t HAVE to be there and have no proof of further plans post August.

1348,1bowlhz,explosivekyushu,"Can I call someone at the Department of Home Affairs to figure outwhat exactly they deemed inadequate for my application and further proof I can provide?
They will just refer you to the letter and won't give you any info beyond that so don't waste your time.
How long do I need to wait to reapply?
You can reapply immediately if you want, but you will need more proof- if you just reapply with mostly the same documentation they'll reject you instantly. I think that your SG student visa expiry really hurt you here, unfortunately.
Would I need to go back to the VFS office and do a biometric collection even though they now have my fingerprints in their system (it's 85 SGD exclusive of the 190 dollar application fee that I really do not want to have to pay again)
I am actually not sure about this but I think that biometrics are per application. If that's right, then yes- you will need to do that again (which I agree is very dumb)
I have family in Sydney that I plan to visit. Would it make more sense to ask them to write a letter on my behalf (they've already agreed) and apply under the sponsored visa stream instead. I did not do this the first time since I only plan to be in Sydney 2 days out of a 2 week trip.

1: Please refer to my answer for Q3.
2: Nothing is a guarantee as it's all a waiting game and the government is prioritising 'in demand' roles at the moment - mainly healthcare.
3: WHV has a long history of foreigners to stay and work in Australia after working for an employer beyond the 6 months. This is because it gives both employers and employees the chance to see if both parties are happy with each other. Think of it as a probationary period.

The results, though, have been underwhelming. A government review published in March found BIIP migrants contributed less to the economy than the average Australian, as the cohort, despite their wealth, tended to be older and earned lower incomes through capital returns on passive investments.”",2023-06-16T09:08:00.747Z

Even just testing is more effective. I don't agree with testing and quarantine, but I would rather be offered this as an option as opposed to being forced to be vaccinated, (c) attempting to stop the spread of Covid is futile anyway, and indeed Australia's policies have completely failed.
All of the commentary and reporting that I have seen has treated the Australian vaccination and border regulations as if they are some unavoidable phenomenon of nature, akin to the sun rising in the morning and the tide rushing in to shore.
I already knew that the media was pathetic and supine before this issue arose, and I also realised that the general public was largely complacent and stupid. However, I truly didn't realise how bad the situation was. I thought that some people working in the media would be capable of some minor examples of critical thinking, but this seems to be completely beyond them. Either that, or they're willing to write and say things that they don't believe in, even when it is completely destroying our society and culture.

Their very entry to countries for participation at major events becomes subject to the whims of that country's government, conditional on them not just taking stipulated medical procedures, but also to them not rocking the boat and upsetting the regime.

You can ask your parents for a letter saying that they'll support you financially if you get in trouble, and expect you to return by a given date.

Worked silly rubbish jobs for fun as I lived off the loan. Call centres, Phone book delivery, bar work and even a porn shop (a porn/pet shop!) Companies were throwing sponsorships offers at us as they didn’t have the workers and wanted us to stay.
Not sure I would recommend it now? It would set any back 18 months from a career in the UK and from what I hear, sponsorships are as rare as hens teeth unless you have certain skills? The cost of living is WAY higher than the $3 to a £1 I was getting which means you are working harder to maintain a decent standard.

1524,1do2979,awndrwmn,"Differences to NZ WHV (from what I read so far):
Documents must be attached to the form before submission and payment (NZ: the application form must be submitted, and the application fee must be paid before submitting evidence).
An application cannot be submitted without the required uploads (NZ: no need to upload anything). There are 200 places instead of 100. Australia has a page where you can see all the country caps, and it gets updated from time to time (NZ: you need to check the per-country page).
Australia pauses intake if the country cap is close to being filled, if there's a high volume of applications, or if other reasons mean the program cannot be opened. It advises checking the status page occasionally (NZ: It is unknown if NZ does the same; they may not announce it).
Country caps open simultaneously at the start of the financial year (NZ: Different dates for different countries).
The minimum health and character requirements appear to be more stringent (NZ: full medical is optional or required only if declaring major illnesses; a PCC is not required since it's only a one-year visa unless character issues are declared).
There appear to be more options for meeting the functional English requirement (NZ: English test, CEMI from college/uni).
Shorter study duration allowed (NZ: 6 months).
Education requirements appear to be lower (NZ: Must be least a 3-year post-secondary program).
A more expensive application fee (NZ: 455 or Php 16,400).
Biometrics may be required. The Philippines is included in Australia's biometrics program. (NZ: no biometrics required).
Onshore applications are not allowed—if you are in Australia on a different visa (except very limited visa types) during processing, the visa can't be issued while onshore (NZ: both allowed for PHWHV).
Longer time with an employer (NZ: 3 months).
Eligibility for second and third 462 visas is 12 months each if the requirements are met (NZ: 3 months only).
More expensive in every aspect :)) (NZ: cheaper).
There does not seem to be a ""race"" in the sense that you can't just speed through the application form if you don't have everything yet, but it could be a race if everyone has everything ready already (NZ: a ""race"").
Medical insurance is suggested, but it is not a requirement.
Similarities:
Some countries fill their quotas quickly even within days of opening. (Aus: Start of financial year, NZ: Specific opening date per country)
There is an age limit of 18-30 years old.
Longer stays may be possible if you work in specific industries. Aus | NZ
Health tests may be completed before applying but don't guarantee approval.
Multiple entries are allowed.
12 consecutive months stay, time spent outside the country isn't added back.
One year to enter the country from approval.
Dependent children are not allowed.
Family members cannot be included in the application.
It is a legal requirement, to be honest and not submit fake documents or misleading information.
FYIs:
If you have used ImmiAccount before, you may know you cannot delete documents once they are uploaded. Please exercise caution when uploading your documents.
You will need a HAP ID to undergo the health tests. This is usually found within the referral letter sent to you, notifying you of the health checks you must do after applying for the visa. The step-by-step page on the Australian immigration website, however, mentions organising health checks before filling out a form. Ensuring that you take the right tests may be confusing, especially for someone unfamiliar with Australian immigration regulations. If you decide to do the health checks before applying, please get the correct advice for your circumstances from a registered migration agent or immigration lawyer.
There will be system maintenance of Aus immigration systems from 2 PM AEST on 30 June 2024 until 9 AM AEST on 1 July 2024.
Please create your ImmiAccount as soon as possible! 😊

Given your age, I would suggest Bologna, it's a university city with many students and young people.

White South African farmers ""Deserve special attention"" from Australia due to the ""Horrific circumstances"" of land seizures and violence, Peter Dutton has said.
Dutton suggested options included the in-country persecution visa category, and to bring them to Australia on humanitarian visas via referrals from others in Australia.
Asked if this could be achieved with the South African government's cooperation, Dutton replied Australia ""Can work with governments all around the world"".

Under that model, it costs Australia ~$270k - $360k for every parent who is granted a contributory parent visa.

In Australia, we would call this sort of placement a “medical elective” if done as part of your medical course for University. You might like to use that term when looking to see what visa is appropriate. Medical electives are not paid, are frequently done overseas from your home country and there’s nothing dodgy about it.
I’m not quite sure what visa you would use - it seems a bit of a grey area. Are you able to get some advice from your university?
Edited to add: actually I think 600 is the way to go. You are coming to STUDY as a medical student. You are not coming to work. My advice is to apply early for the visa. It’s possible you might need to have a health examination to get the visa if you’re going to be entering a healthcare facility in Australia.",2024-04-03T11:20:34.208Z

1680,1dsn68g,daveliot,"The Australian government has more than doubled the cost of student visa fees for international students, prompting outrage from student representatives who say that the price hike will drive potential students to competitors. From July 1, the international student visa fee has risen to $1,600 from $710. The federal government said the additional revenue will help fund initiatives in education including cuts to graduate debt, financial support for apprentices, and the ongoing implementation of its migration strategy......
.....Phil Honeywood, CEO of the International Education Association of Australia, told the ABC that the announcement was the ""last straw"" for the international education sector, which has already suffered from a slowdown in visa approvals.""We are really in danger of losing a $48 billion a year industry,"" Mr Honeywood said....
.....The increase is part of the government's move to curb net migration which rose to a record 528,000 people in 2022-2023 after COVID restrictions were removed.
Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said the changes will create ""a migration system which is fairer, smaller and better able to deliver for Australia,"" in a statement.
Senior migration lawyer Sean Dong told the ABC he believed the decision would severely impact the intake number of international students in the next few years. Around 440,000 hopeful international students applied for a student visa from July 2023 to May 2024.""It is not going to be a good solution, it will impact the revenue stream of the universities,"" he added.The visa fee hike follows plans to cap the number of international students.

Some context: my husband has studied and stayed in Australia for 2 years.
The only thing I’m concerned about in the application is that I’ve clearly mentioned in the cover letter that my husband will be bearing all my expenses and have attached his bank statements along with mine. His balance is much higher than mine. Mine is around 5500 AU$. Is that a concern since my personal bank balance isn’t high enough?

Sebelumnya....realitas kerja WHV tahun 2022 (tidak ada batasan kerja 6 bulan di satu perusahaan, dengan pengecualian tertentu) itu beda dengan tahun 2023 dan sangat beda dengan tahun 2024. Yang di sosial media itu realitas anak2 tahun 2022-2023. Anak WHV sampai Australia tahun 2022 itu bisa dapat kerja dalam waktu beberapa hari setelah mendarat. Anak WHV sampai Australia tahun 2024 itu lebih susah cari kerjanya.
Australia is also known with its great work life balance culture too (35 hours/week is the norm)
Kalau WHV, kerjanya bakal lebih dari ini kalau mau ngejar di atas 1000-1500 AUD per minggu.
What happens after the visa expires?
Pulang, atau :
apply student visa untuk sekolah di sekolah ecek2 demi meneruskan kerja blue collarnya, dan seringnya nanti ambil cash karena student visa holder ada batasan waktu kerjanya (48 jam per 2 minggu).
disponsorin visa kerja. Ini tergantung skill, pengalaman kerja dan ijazah kamu sekarang. Tidak mustahil, tapi unlikely. Yang saya tahu rata2 IT (programmer dll) atau chef. Kalau mau kamu silakan sebutin kerja,skill dan ijazah. Saya percaya diri bisa 75persenan bilang bisa atau tidak. Sekali lagi, jalan ini unlikely.
apply student visa untuk sekolah beneran di Australia, demi mencari PR (Permanent Resident). Jadi kerja WHVnya itu untuk modal sekolah di Australia. Ini perjuangan agak berat dan kemungkinan besar harus ganti karir dan skill. Nursing, aged care, IT, dll. Rata2 pada ambil aged care atau nursing.
Does taking a break from your career to work in a different field make it challenging to return to your original path?
Saya pribadi menyarankan WHV sebagai bahan mencari modal usaha (resign dari pekerjaan sebelumnya selamanya) atau beli rumah (bekerja lagi di Indonesia, tergantung bisa atau tidak).",2024-01-15T04:13:17.677Z

1782,196yyhu,sitdowndisco,"So... I'm Australian and have a lot of friends who are currently on or were on WHV. Most of these friends arrived pre-covid and are only just finishing their 4 or 5 years on WHV/Covid visas etc. These people had the best experience because they were able to stay and work for more than the normal 3 years (due to covid visas), they had no competition for jobs (WHV holders left australia during covid, so people who stayed were able to get better jobs) and they were able to access a range of government free money (eg relocation assistance, money to take a covid test).
It is more difficult now for Indonesians to get the best jobs in Australia when on WHV and in my experience this is because they aim too low compared to other nationalities. Many Koreans who arrive have a very solid plan in place to take the best jobs (like operating a forklift) whereas many Indonesians just try and get any job they can to fill their bank accounts. That's OK, but you always need to be trying to get a better job in a better industry.
I think WHV is the best opportunity for many young Indonesians to save money. It is realistic to save 600jt+ in one year. Even more if you have a friend to share costs with and you can keep working all through the year.
Many Indonesian friends of mine don't want to return to Indonesia after working in Australia because they can't see themselves ever working for UMR in Indonesia again. Most of them try and use the money they saved doing WHV to search for a pathway to PR (usually via study, sometimes by marrying an Australian).
As a general rule, the best jobs for WHV workers are in cotton gin, winery, almonds harvest, rice harvest, grain harvest, solar farm. These jobs are very competitive and it's difficult to get one if you don't have any experience. You will usually start in the harder jobs like picking blueberries or mangoes and if you manage to get a job on a farm driving a machine (loader, forklift, tractor), you have a better chance of getting one of the good jobs in cotton, grain or winery.
One last recommendation. Go regional. Staying in the cities and working as a barista can be a nice lifestyle, but you won't save any money. You need to go regional and stay there. It's where the money is, following the seasons. Oh, and never work for an Indonesian.

BRASILIA Brazil's government is considering waiving visas for visitors from the United States, Japan, Canada and Australia to boost tourism, and could eventually extend the plan to include China, a tourism ministry spokesman said on Monday.
The minister's proposal still needs approval by other departments of the Brazilian government, particularly the foreign ministry which issues the visas and has demanded reciprocity to exempt U.S. citizens from needing visas.
Visitors from most Latin American and European Union nations, and Russia, do not need visas to travel to Brazil, but U.S. travelers have to cough up $160 for a visa to visit Brazil, an identical fee charged to Brazilians for visas to visit the United States.

1809,18wiwwg,JoeTheRMA,"Bit of a disagreement among previous commenters about whether leaving and re-entering to reset the stay period will be ""frowned upon"". I'm a little late to the thread but just wanted to provide some context around this.
Legally, the 651 visa requires you to be a ""genuine temporary entrant"" (GTE). There is no fixed legal definition of what this means, and in reality, that gives DHA decision-makers and border officers a degree of freedom to exercise their subjective judgement.
The most common way in which the ""frowned upon"" element is manifested is when you're re-entering the country, where border agents may question you about your intentions (we've all seen the show Border Security).
The more serious way you could run afoul of the law would be a notice of intention to consider cancellation, however this is usually rare unless you are exiting and re-entering in a really obvious way to subvert the GTE requirement over multiple occasions.
Neither of these appear to have happened to you. As long as things stay that way, you are unlikely to see any consequences of being ""frowned upon"" by the Department.
Will you run into trouble if you keep exiting and re-entering several times a year, and keep reapplying for 651s year after year to maintain de facto residence? Yes, absolutely. Will it happen with your current movement history? Unlikely.
Hopefully it is clear that both ends of the opinion spectrum that people have mentioned are correct - this is not a simple black & white issue.
In terms of its impact on your partner visa application - as long as your 651 is not subject to enforcement action, you should not have any issues making a partner visa application. The main focus is whether you meet the eligibility criteria of the partner visa itself - which is dependent on your personal circumstances and a different topic of discussion.
Hope that helps.

We're looking at around 120 visa types, a staggering bureaucracy, a million people waiting in the pipeline, and processing times that drag out for half a decade or more. Meanwhile, migrants are being cornered into sticking to one job and students are hitting rock-bottom trying to make ends meet with limited work hours. And let's not get started on the convoluted rules and costs involved in establishing relationships.
Why not ditch the whole administrative nightmare and bring economics into the game? We've all heard economists say that if demand greatly outstrips supply, then the price is too low. So why not apply that principle to visas? Imagine a ""visa rental"" system where we set the price such that the demand for visas equals the supply of visas (i.e., the number of people we're willing to let in). It would be a weekly rent and would add to government revenue.
This way, we're essentially ensuring that those who want to come in the most will be the ones coming in. By natural selection, job roles with a shortage would attract migrants, as these roles would offer higher pay than equivalent jobs overseas. This would also give local employees more bargaining power.

I got approval within 2 days when I applied in August 2022, and I was approved for my second year visa within 1 day this past September. When applying, make sure you get every document you possibly can to submit with the application. They also require proof of at least $5000AUD (around $3000USD last I checked, you can use a currency converter on google for the exact amount). I saved about $6000USD on top of ticket price, baggage checks, etc, and it was definitely a good amount to have for me. The ticket alone was around $1,400USD, but I also booked it only a week in advance.
Look at a few general areas, research hostels and other housing options in those areas, and make an estimated budget based on where you plan to stay, what kind of job you plan to get to support yourself while you're here, what activities you may be interested in, if any. As for where to go, I live in a town called Mackay, and if you like sun this is a good place. It's pretty, its peaceful, it feels like constant summer, and the people here have been very welcoming. Not too judgy, which I found a little surprising. I haven't been anywhere else yet, so I can't speak on other places.
It's not too hard of a process, just make sure you have the proper paperwork. There's an entire step by step list of what to do/have on the Australian immigration website, and they have estimated processing times on there as well. The link for the Work and Holiday Visa--> https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/work-holiday-462/first-work-holiday-462
I used a company called Visa First and they did the whole submission process for me the first time, cost about $500, I think, but their rates may be different now. Just had to send them copies of all my documents and they did the rest. If you submit yourself, the current price is $635AUD, which should be somewhere between $400-$500USD.
All in all, my planning took about 6 months, but that's just because I needed literally everything, including a passport, and I had to wait for it all to process. Plan according to what you need to wait for, if anything, and how long the estimated time is on the immigration website.

I'm Australian but I did the WHV thing with my girlfriend. These are a couple of things I'd suggest:
we always had a place to stay, but from what I've observed with other backpackers, finding affordable accommodation can be an absolute nightmare, especially in Melbourne and Sydney. Look into it before you come. You can find Facebook groups where people advertise rooms and also use Gumtree.
get a car or a van ASAP, preferably something you can sleep in. Unless you want to stay in a big city the whole time, you will need it to truly experience Australia.
if you want to find work for your visa extension, don't just stick around towns along the East Coast, whether that be NSW or Queensland, or in Melbourne because that's what most people do. We found work just by turning up to random pubs in inland Queensland and enquiring.
if you want accommodation as part of the deal with work, you may have some luck on dairy farms or in rural/remote pubs. Bear in mind that working on a dairy farm SUCKS.

You also have to pay out for a skills assessment and English exam just to submit that EOI as well as any extra costs for certification/translation of documents, police checks etc. After getting the invite you also have to pay out for the health exam plus any travel if there isn't a panel physician near you. I paid out around an extra £1000 for these extra essentials and I didn't get a migration agent which will add another £1000 or more.

Rant start:
Need that fucking visa ASAP before my Dad's health issues get serious. Plus I'm having to tolerate a shitty job because of these Home Affairs pricks. Despite being finally invited, I 110% regret trying to immigrate to Australia via student visa and ever since I came back I've been persuading people left, right and center not to immigrate to Australia via this shitshow student visa-focused 'points-based' system. Think I've saved the life and savings of so many younger fellows by sparing them this horseshit torture. FYI, I discourage all non-scholarship, full-fee paying third-world students now from migrating via student visa to US/UK/Australia/Canada because of how expensive the degrees are and how all 4 immigration systems of these countries suck.
Personally, I admit I spent too much money, delayed my personal and professional life too long for these cunts. 120% if given the opportunity to go back in time, I would go to a mainland European country on a student visa with lower tuition, learn the language if required, tolerate whatever weather is required and undergo a simple af immigration system which just requires you have a work-permit based job that is renewed every year instead of this sham of a 'points-based' system.

Once Coronavirus hit it became more obvious that there's no ""skill shortage"" of dishwashers or other low-skill entry level jobs and that those jobs were given the skill-shortage status to allow for immigrants/temporary residents to be exploited by greedy companies wanting bottom dollar for maximal effort.
I remember talking to a Hong Kongese international student who served me at a big chain restaurant who was telling me he gets rostered on for the weekends, just to sit around at half pay for the most part ""in case it gets busy"". If it gets busy he would start working to help his co-workers and only then he would be paid his full hourly (which was still significantly shit).
The thing is he had no concept it was illegal or wrong, and that's what these businesses love about international students and migrants or whatever. Fuck them all. Exploitative cunts.",2021-12-01T20:11:22.878Z

Nijisanji IN was definitely a swing and a miss and had such a rocky history when you consider their temporary re-branding to Niji EN then back to IN once they started to hold auditions for an actual EN branch.
I do feel bad for Noor, Aadya and Vihaan though as I feel they were severly limited by their hardware. I remember giving them a shot when I first heard of them, but both Aadya and Vihaan had very laggy streams (whether because of their hardware or internet, who can say) and even Noor, the most popular of the group, had pretty bad audio on her streams.
I kinda hope we do get to see them again in the future, especially since they all do speak English well enough, but I can imagine that this whole experience could have soured the vtuber experience for them.

I figured it'd be fine to just wrap it up during the ceremony, I mean surely everyone would understand the importance of Miyamoto's baby. How was I to face graduation and adulthood, if I did not help Link face Ganon first. So I was glued to the screen the entire time, not clapping once for my classmates. I had to stay focused. I popped at least 5 red bulls and 7 five hour energies to stay alert while fighting moblins and dodongoes. I even made sure to give out a loud Link grunt (Yes that's Link not Zelda) every time he did in the game. I thought that must've invigorated the other graduates, they must've been inspired. When my name was called, I was in the midst of the final battle and did not hear it. The vile bully behind me (must've been a Sony Pony) pushed my gaze away and nudged me to prematurely accept my diploma. I politely urged him in the name of Reggie to stop but he became more and more angry. Why? Did he not want Link to succeed and save both Hyrule and Zelda? In a final act of cruelty, he took my switch and smashed it on the ground. At first I looked in horror at what he did to my splatoon oled, and then it turned to rage. I snapped and immediately tackled the fiend to the ground. I believe Iwata from the Heavens gave me strength, and so I bit his ear off. Icky blood squirted everywhere, glad that's not in any Nintendo classics! Afterwards, instead of the expected praise from the crowd, some brutes pushed me to the ground and held me there.

Most expats I know have lived in Kuwait for long enough or more to have been eligible for citizenship in other countries, had they moved there instead. I also think it's important to consider that countries where you have to pay tax aren't the outliers, it's countries that are tax-free like Kuwait that are the outliers. If people all over the world manage to do it, it surely can't be that difficult to eventually get adjusted to.
I personally am not conservative and would prefer a more liberal lifestyle, one in which people are not looked at differently based on religion, nationality, and gender.

2148,14tiyal,empleadoEstatalBot,"[Dutch government collapses over immigration policy](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte speaks at a news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron (not pictured) during Macron's state visit to the Netherlands, in Amsterdam, Netherlands April 12, 2023. REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw/File Photo)
AMSTERDAM, July 7 (Reuters) - The Dutch government on Friday collapsed after failing to reach a deal on restricting immigration, junior coalition partner Christian Union said, a move expected to trigger new elections in the fall.
""The four parties decided that they cannot reach an agreement on migration. Therefore they decided to end this government,"" party spokesman Tim Kuijsten said, confirming media reports that Prime Minister Mark Rutte would tender the resignation of his government.
The crisis was triggered by a push by Rutte's conservative VVD party to limit the flow of asylum seekers to the Netherlands, which split his four-party government coalition when two parties refused to support his proposals.
Tensions came to a head this week, when Rutte demanded support for a proposal to limit entrance for children of war refugees who are already in the Netherlands and to make families wait at least two years before they can be united.
This last proposal went too far for the small Christian Union and liberal D66, triggering a crisis.
""It's a sad day,"" Defence Minister Kajsa Ollongren said as she arrived for an emergency cabinet meeting called after the migration talks ended in a stalemate.
""We have talked for a long time, but we have failed to reach agreement.""
Rutte will hold a press conference after the cabinet meeting, his office said.
The Netherlands already has a one of Europe's toughest immigration policies but under the pressure of right-wing parties, Rutte had for months been trying to seek ways to further reduce the inflow of asylum seekers.
Asylum applications in the Netherlands jumped by a third last year to over 46,000, and the government has projected they could increase to more than 70,000 this year - topping the previous high of 2015.
This will again put a strain on the country's asylum facilities, where for months last year hundreds of refugees at a time were forced to sleep in the rough with little or no access to drinking water, sanitary facilities or health care.
Rutte last year said he felt ""ashamed"" of the problems, after humanitarian group Medecins sans Frontieres sent in a team to the Netherlands for the first time ever, to assist with migrants' medical needs at the centre for processing asylum requests.
He promised to improve conditions at the facilities, mainly by reducing the number of refugees that reach the Netherlands. But he failed to win the backing of coalition partners who felt his policies went too far.
Rutte, 56, is the longest-serving government leader in Dutch history and the most senior in the EU after Hungary's Viktor Orban. He is expected to lead his VVD party again at the next elections.
Rutte's current coalition, which came to power in January 2022, was his fourth consecutive administration since he became prime minister in October 2010.

The Dutch king has sworn in former spy chief Dick Schoof as prime minister of a government promising to deliver the Netherlands’ “strictest-ever” immigration policy.
Mr Schoof takes over from Mark Rutte, the longest-serving prime minister in Dutch history, 223 days after Geert Wilders won a shock victory in an election that stunned Europe.
He presented his ministers in the Right-wing coalition to Willem-Alexander in the ornate “Oranjezaal” in the royal palace, with them each stepping forward to swear allegiance to the king and the constitution.
Mr Wilders, the populist firebrand leader of the Freedom Party (PVV), was forced to shelve his ambitions to become prime minister to keep coalition talks on track.
There were fears his campaign promises to ban the Koran and hold a Nexit referendum on Dutch EU membership were too extreme.
Instead, the four coalition partners agreed their leaders would not be in government before compromising on Mr Schoof, 67, who previously ran the Dutch secret service.
Mr Wilders, who campaigned for “zero asylum seekers”, secured backing for a crackdown on asylum and migration from the pro-business VVD party, radical centrist NSC and farmers’ party the BBB.
The coalition has pledged a two-year asylum crisis act to drive down numbers arriving in the Netherlands and to demand an opt-out from EU asylum rules, which will put the new government on a collision course with Brussels.
It plans a maximum reduction in migrant numbers without giving a hard figure. The agreement includes austere reception centres, a hold on processing asylum applications and only temporary asylum being granted.
The 26-page coalition agreement, titled Hope, courage and pride, also calls for considering the idea of moving the Dutch embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
Seven youth branches of Dutch political parties, including the VVD and NSC, called on the new government to reconsider the asylum plans on Tuesday.
They said that the asylum crisis was actually a reception crisis caused by a staffing and housing shortage that left asylum centres overcrowded.
Amnesty International held a protest outside the royal palace as the ministers were sworn in.

In terms of the global issue of refugees, resettlement is never a viable option for solving it when there are 60 million worldwide. Especially considering the population of Africa is going to grow by over a billion in 30 years whilst the tax payers in the West are stable or shrinking.
Germany has taken in over a million in a single year and the worldwide number of refugees still went up.

But there is no such queue, because countries are not obliged to take in refugees assigned for resettlement by the UN; if they do, it is purely good will. Signatories to the UN refugee convention are, however, obliged to assess the claims of asylum seekers reaching their shores. Australia is a society obsessed with rules and fairness, and the queue-jumping argument resonates perfectly with a population primed to think in terms of orderly regulations, most of whom have never faced state-sponsored violence or war crimes. By this logic, whether or not you have had your hand chopped off doesn’t matter if you broke the “rules” to get to Australia.
The problem is, however, is that if we accept there is no ""queue,"" then the public will indefinitely support the boat policy, because the alternative is a free-for-all in which we accept any of the 50 million asylum seekers in the world today (excluding all those who would try and make the journey if we did).",2017-10-12T08:35:30.707Z

Without water you die quickly. Go into the Australian desert unprepared and you can be dead in hours.
Australia doesn't have a lot of freshwater. Even the big cities in the temperate/sub-tropical regions like Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth have desalination plants. These cities are in ""green"" areas. The only places with abundant freshwater are north east Queensland (tropical seaside areas with a nice mountain range to dam) and the monsoon areas in the northern territory and far north of WA (Lake Argyle, The Kakadu).
North Queensland is decently settled, but suffers from Tropical Cyclones. It's also full of scary shit like Coastal Taipains, Cassowarys, crocodiles and the worst of all, rural Queenslanders.
Northern Territory and the areas around Kununurra in northern Western Australia are similarly full of scary things and cyclones plus you get the monsoon which means months of challenges moving around. Plus there are two seasons in that area: Fucking hot and dry and fucking hot and wet. Oh, and the tidal range is 7 metres (23 feet in freedumb units).
I am not saying you can't live in these areas, indigenous peoples did for millennia. That being said, there were still more of them on the coast than the desert.
In Western Australia, we built a dam on the Ord river for the purpose of agriculture and development, this reservoir became Lake Argyle. Second largest freshwater reservoir on the continent. It's huge (and yes, there are freshwater crocodiles in it). It spawned a town to service the dam and the agriculture to follow.
The town is called Kununurra and has a population of 5,300. Mean minimum temperature is 21c (71F) and mean high is 35c (95f) maximum high is 45c (111f). It's 3,000 km from the state capital Perth. It's 800km from Darwin. Unsurprisingly, if you grow up there and don't want to be a farmer or related you leave and don't come back.
Back in the mid 2010s the government formed an infrastructure fund to try and get development moving in these areas. Put $5 billion AUD into the fund. Four fifths of fuck all happened with the money (it didn't help that the government was dumb as fuck conservatives who blocked any renewables development with this money).

Former President Donald J. Trump is claiming that nine documents seized by the F.B.I. from his Florida residence are his personal property — but the Justice Department says they are official records that should be deposited with the National Archives, according to a new letter to the special master who is overseeing a review of the materials.
The letter, filed on Thursday by the Justice Department, describes disputes over ownership and executive privilege claims involving a batch of 15 records that have undergone early review. It likely foreshadows larger fights to come over the main bulk of roughly 13,000 documents and other materials F.B.I. agents took from Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s club and residence, in a court-authorized search in August.
The materials from the initial tranche that Mr. Trump maintains belong to him include six packages submitted to him when he was president supporting requests that he grant clemency to pardon-seekers; two documents related to his administration’s immigration policies; and an email addressed to him from a person at a military academy, it said.
But the Justice Department, in its letter, scoffed at the notion that any of those materials belong to Mr. Trump. It cited the Presidential Records Act, which says all documentary materials created or received by a president, his staff or his office in the course of official activities are government property that should go to the National Archives when a president leaves office.
Of the pardon packages, for example, the Justice Department wrote: “Those requests were received by plaintiff in his capacity as the official with authority to grant reprieves and pardons, not in his personal capacity.”
The dispute stems from a decision by Judge Aileen M. Cannon in Florida’s Southern District to grant Mr. Trump’s request that she intervene in the Justice Department’s inquiry into whether he had unlawfully kept classified records at his estate and obstructed the government’s repeated efforts to retrieve them.",2022-10-21T14:18:52.265Z

It serves the corporatist overlords that actually run our country. It floods our labor market. That in turns drives down the price of labor and creates armies of desperate people that are willing to work three shitty, minimum wage jobs just to get by.
It's not an accident that since 1970 our population has grown by over 100m people. In 50 years our population shot up over 50%. source: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/popchange-data-text.html
I have no problem with the number of immigrants coming into the United States
You might reconsider that. It's one of the reasons our floor remains so low while cost of living keeps rising. It's a matter of supply and demand. When you have 100 jobs for 80 people, wages rise. When you have 100 jobs for 120 people, wages drop. Same goes with housing, same goes with everything people need. Prices rise as demand does.
We don't need to stop immigration, but we definitely need to keep it at a level that we can handle. If our population had grown by 20% instead of 50% over the last 50 years wages would be higher and housing prices would be lower. We'd be much better able to provide both for current citizens and those coming to join our nation if we kept the influx at a slower pace.",2023-09-22T15:59:08.126Z

2314,16p8ny1,LucidLeviathan,"We are hearing a lot about ""chaos at the border"" because it seems to be one of the few things that reliably riles up the average conservative voter. Lots of other culture war issues have proven salient with the hardest core of the Republican base, but the iffy moderate just is not really all that motivated by those issues. Immigration is the only one that has reliably stuck, and Republicans have been harping on it since the 80s.
Democrats have, on multiple occasions, attempted to reach across the aisle to fix the problem and create an orderly, legal pathway to citizenship. Republicans have rebuffed them. Many of these proposals have gotten broad bipartisan support until the political spin doctors realized that their golden issue was about to be swiped out from under their noses.
Republican approaches to the border are largely theatrical productions. The Trump wall is a big, flashy object that has not, will not, and would not do much to actually curb illegal immigration. Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott shuffling migrants around the nation hasn't done much to help solve the problem. Republicans love to complain and complain about the issue, but never propose any actual solutions. There's a good reason for this - if the issue were solved, they'd be out of office. Their other policies are wildly unpopular, especially in the era of Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Paul Gosar, and Lauren Boebert essentially holding the House of Representatives hostage.
The reasons for the current migrant surge are pretty obvious, and have little to do with any US policy:
Unrest and upheavals in South American and Central American countries
Global warming causing warmer parts of the world (South and Central America) to have lower crop yields
Unrealized demand that was tamped down during COVID
None of these have much to do with US policy. We can't control the supply of people seeking to cross the border.
Finally, while you say that you love immigration, implicit in your post is the notion that illegal immigration is bad. However, the economists that birthed the Republican approach to immigration believed that immigration was good so long as it was illegal. Source.
Why is it that Trump rails against immigrants? It gets him votes. Why is it that Republicans block legal pathways to immigration? Because they want it to remain illegal. Why is it that we are constantly hearing about ""chaos at the border""? Because Republicans have nothing else to talk about.",2023-09-22T12:43:33.884Z

Mongol Invasions (13th Century): The Mongol Empire, under the leadership of Genghis Khan, successfully breached the Great Wall and invaded China in the early 13th century. The most famous breach occurred in 1211 when the Mongols, after a protracted siege, captured the Jin Dynasty's strategic stronghold of Yehuling.
Jurchen Jin Dynasty: Prior to establishing the Yuan Dynasty, the Mongols, under the leadership of Genghis Khan, and later his successors, broke through the Great Wall to invade the Jin Dynasty, which controlled northern China. The capture of key fortresses like Yehuling and the surrender of the Jin capital Zhongdu (modern-day Beijing) were pivotal events.
Manchu Invasion (17th Century): The Manchu, who established the Qing Dynasty, successfully breached the Great Wall at Shanhaiguan in 1644, leading to the fall of the Ming Dynasty. This event is known as the Battle of Shanhaiguan.
Dzungar Invasions (18th Century): The Dzungar Khanate, a nomadic confederation in Central Asia, invaded China several times in the 18th century, bypassing the Great Wall through less fortified areas in the northwest.
Japanese Invasions (20th Century): During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), Japan invaded China and captured significant portions of territory, including Beijing and other regions near the Great Wall. The wall was not a substantial obstacle for modern military forces.
Mongolian Incursions (20th Century): In the mid-20th century, there were several border skirmishes between China and the Mongolian People's Republic, which eventually led to border agreements and the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Mongolia.",2023-09-22T12:37:26.976Z

Our major cities are full and under infrastructure and environmental stress. Pouring in more migrants to the levels of the past will just exacerbate the situation and negatively impact the already strained liveability . The solution needs to be a mixture of development of local skills and a temepered immigration program to fill the genuine gaps.
Comments from Bob Carr in 2017
..Carr says that by the early 2000s the NSW government was spending about double what it had been in the 1990s on infrastructure and still struggling to keep up with increasing demands.
He dismissed the argument that the population growth could be accommodated with better planning. “Any idiot can say ‘it’s just a matter of infrastructure’, as though nobody had thought of that before.
“Every suburb of Sydney, except those with political protection like Point Piper and Ku-ring-gai, is being transformed.”
Carr also challenges the argument that high immigration benefited the nation by sustaining growth. “It is a pretty lazy growth model. It is as if we have given up any innovation for an economy based on throwing up apartment blocks and shopping malls.”
He believes high immigration is being sustained politically due to the disconnect between those who benefit and those who pay – federal governments benefit from economic growth immigration spurs, while a handful of state governments foot the bill.
“It is effectively a Canberra conspiracy against the rest of the nation…
Carr does not believe that new immigrants can be encouraged to spread across the nation either, in part because unlike the United States it does not have a vast inland river system. Population, he says, will continue to gravitate to the south-east, which will soon attain levels of density “you can’t even imagine”.",2022-09-02T01:36:13.075Z

2364,188f8li,[deleted],"I think here are some level headed solutions then ""ban all immigration""
-Reduce international students intake (maybe a max of 200k a year or something) and increase requirements to an IELTS level of 7.5 or higher. You will end up with a lot more diverse intake of students and students who have the intelligence to integrate into canada.
-Deny anyone ability to seek refugee status or govt relief or welfare programs on a work or student visa. If they cant sustain themselves here, send them back immediately.
-Eliminate TFW program for low skilled jobs.
-All immigration streams need a quota system of max of 10% of immigration from one country. If our goal is multiculturalism then lets be multicultural.
-Bring in a 3 year Construction worker Visa to Pr system to get workers to build housing.
-Strict ban on anyone coming on vistor visa to work in canada (the govt allows this in some cases lol)
-Ban parental PR system. Anyone's parents want to come to canada, get a 10 year super visa and pay for the health insurance.

I've worked in tech in both the US and Canada and which one is ""better"" depends on where you're at in life.
Are you a young, healthy, single male? You're probably better off in the States because your absolute income will be higher while you consume very little in health and social services.
Are you in your early 30s and looking to start a family? If your employer has a generous family benefits package, you're probably better off in the States because of the income difference. If you're not the fortunate few with such a benefits package, you're probably better off in Canada because of the stronger health and social support system.
Do you already have a family and aren't in the 1%? Then you're almost certainly better off in Canada because the quality of life is higher and family support services are much better.

At that point the arrests did not occur. The arrests were deliberately caused by locking arms and disrupting the parade. Through this act we hoped to gain more visibility. When the police escorted the protesters out of the way of the parade, they peacefully followed the officers and were arrested off to the side of the parade.
If anyone’s been to a Philly parade they know that pedestrians are allowed to and do cross in the middle constantly. In our case we sat it out and stayed a bit longer for visibility. We just want to make the atrocities going on more visible and pass on our message as Jews and supporters that we will not silently let concentration camps exist.

I am a Canadian-American international student who was in Australia when covid hit. I finished my undergrad degree overseas. I decided I also want to do my postgrad overseas and immigrate to Australia permanently.
Thus, I have just enrolled in a Doctor of Physiotherapy course in Australia, which was going to commence this July, 2021. I was supposed to be onshore by this July to start my new course, however, due to the course’s clinical hands-on nature, the uni won’t let us complete any part of the course online (and rightfully so). So, my uni postponed my course start date until July 2022, thus I won’t graduate until 2025. It was sad realizing I won’t be back this year, but I know I will make the best out of a gap year!
Do you think that vaccinated international students will be allowed into Australia by July 2022?
Physiotherapists are currently on the skilled shortage workers visa list. Do you think that physiotherapist will be a career on that list for a while? Say, 2025-2026 when it would be my time to apply for the skilled shortage visa after doing a year on a post-grad visa? I assume yes, due to the aging population. However, I know things change all the time.
I’m not sure if you could answer any of these questions since the future is so unknown, especially now, however I know you are an immigration expert and thought maybe you would know a few things, given the past patterns of the skilled shortage workers list, and any recent news about students’ return. I would greatly appreciate any insight, as if I can’t get back to Australia by 2022, I may start looking into other countries/unis so that I can become a physiotherapist before my undergraduate pre-requisite units expire (like anatomy, biomechanics, physiology, statistics etc.). I would not want to have to redo my undergrad, haha!",2021-03-29T21:28:06.239Z

They want to bring me (and my partner) over on a 482 visa once the travel situation gets better - I understand travel exemptions are possible for software engineers as that is an occupation on the PMSOL list, but apparently flight ticket prices etc. are still prohibitively steep...
Let's say I get the 482 visa for 2 years and then want to apply for PR. From what I understand the 190 skilled regional-nominated visa is probably the best bet. However, I have a feeling the points requirement would still be pretty high for NSW (thanks to Sydney)...is that something you can confirm?
As an aside, any idea regarding processing times for 482 visas for people on the PMSOL list atm? For the medium term stream, the IMMI website says 75% hear back within 5 months...is that accurate in your experience?

I watched the YouTube video you linked in your post which seems to suggest the best route to PR currently is finding a university course to study an occupation that doesn’t require work experience, in the state you’d like to live in. Have I understood that correctly? If so, I’m considering studying midwifery over there as I know nurses are needed but the fees look extortionate. Does the gov offer any support or grants for international students wanting to study a much needed occupation? For info we’d be looking to move to Sydney.
Secondly, my partner is an electronics engineer with a masters degree and 2 years experience. We’ve been told by an immigration agent that the 190 visa is our best bet to move over there, and electronics engineer looks to be on the MLTSSL. However, I’m having trouble getting my head around the state sponsorship aspect. How are 190 visas more likely to be granted than 189? Does the state have access to the skill select database/EOIs and dip in when there’s a particular shortage? And would those with 90+ points not always still get priority, like with the 189?
For info, we’ve already used up our working holiday visas living out there in 2018. I’d be grateful for any insight! Many thanks in advance!",2021-03-30T15:56:46.097Z

2610,1cbmghz,Extension-Active4025,"Given the political climate this was inevitable. Government wants to cut numbers, needs to, as would the opposition if they got in. General public perceptions towards immigration isn't good and only getting worse, exacerbated by a housing crisis.
To achieve this, the high risk nationalities were always destined to cop the worst of it. They are more likely to want to stay after, they are more likely to bring family, and due to terrible wages/standards back home they are more likely to select easy, trivial courses to A) get in and B) be able to maximise working. Negative stereotypical connotations about these nationalities doing this means the change will likely be looked upon very favourably by and large.
Ironically despite a lot of back and forth arguments on the implications, the government could really win on all fronts on this. They are seen as taking decisive actions to reduce numbers and target fraudulent applications. Whilst unis are propped up largely on a lucrative international market, demand is so high at present, especially from the listed countries that they can really start cutting numbers and increasing rejections to whatever level they choose to balance keeping that international cash flow. Hopefully it can really start to weed out those fraudulent applications so the genuine students are arriving. One of the real travesties about visas is how a small minority of fraudulent applicants from these countries make it so much harder for their countrymen that are genuine.
Good on Germany for being proactive on filling their shortages (in theory no different to what the skilled visas are doing here). Not sure how quickly or effectively Indians will transition from speaking English, which is currently taught, to German. Or how long the good times there will last.

2648,mfq5q1,plant-gal,"THANK YOU so much for this post! I love your posts, I remember the last one being super helpful and loved the way you laid out all the info in this one! I have a few questions if that would be okay!
I am a Canadian-American international student who was in Australia when covid hit. I finished my undergrad degree overseas. I decided I also want to do my postgrad overseas and immigrate to Australia permanently.
Thus, I have just enrolled in a Doctor of Physiotherapy course in Australia, which was going to commence this July, 2021. I was supposed to be onshore by this July to start my new course, however, due to the course’s clinical hands-on nature, the uni won’t let us complete any part of the course online (and rightfully so). So, my uni postponed my course start date until July 2022, thus I won’t graduate until 2025. It was sad realizing I won’t be back this year, but I know I will make the best out of a gap year!
Do you think that vaccinated international students will be allowed into Australia by July 2022?
Physiotherapists are currently on the skilled shortage workers visa list. Do you think that physiotherapist will be a career on that list for a while? Say, 2025-2026 when it would be my time to apply for the skilled shortage visa after doing a year on a post-grad visa? I assume yes, due to the aging population. However, I know things change all the time.
I’m not sure if you could answer any of these questions since the future is so unknown, especially now, however I know you are an immigration expert and thought maybe you would know a few things, given the past patterns of the skilled shortage workers list, and any recent news about students’ return. I would greatly appreciate any insight, as if I can’t get back to Australia by 2022, I may start looking into other countries/unis so that I can become a physiotherapist before my undergraduate pre-requisite units expire (like anatomy, biomechanics, physiology, statistics etc.). I would not want to have to redo my undergrad, haha!",2021-03-29T21:28:06.239Z
2649,mfq5q1,yellow_magician,"Hi! I'm in the UK and currently have a job offer from a company in Sydney for a software engineering role.
They want to bring me (and my partner) over on a 482 visa once the travel situation gets better - I understand travel exemptions are possible for software engineers as that is an occupation on the PMSOL list, but apparently flight ticket prices etc. are still prohibitively steep...
Let's say I get the 482 visa for 2 years and then want to apply for PR. From what I understand the 190 skilled regional-nominated visa is probably the best bet. However, I have a feeling the points requirement would still be pretty high for NSW (thanks to Sydney)...is that something you can confirm?
As an aside, any idea regarding processing times for 482 visas for people on the PMSOL list atm? For the medium term stream, the IMMI website says 75% hear back within 5 months...is that accurate in your experience?

Obviously this would affect my points and if I want to apply for PR this might limit me further. There is another option available for me.

The plan was for me to move to Sydney a few months later (probably on sponsored work visa, but didn't figure out exact details, the world felt more care-free back then) but then COVID hit and now we've been apart for a year. Currently thinking Working Holiday Visa (or Tourist visa) -> 820 -> 801 is probably the route for us. Does the fact that I've been on a 457 before affect this? How do you think the fact that we've been physically apart for over a year now will affect our defacto status?

2653,mfq5q1,milliemay40,"Hi, thanks so much for this useful post. It brings together a high-level analysis of what my partner and I have been trying to navigate for the past month or so! I had a couple of questions I’d be grateful for your advice on:
I watched the YouTube video you linked in your post which seems to suggest the best route to PR currently is finding a university course to study an occupation that doesn’t require work experience, in the state you’d like to live in. Have I understood that correctly? If so, I’m considering studying midwifery over there as I know nurses are needed but the fees look extortionate. Does the gov offer any support or grants for international students wanting to study a much needed occupation? For info we’d be looking to move to Sydney.
Secondly, my partner is an electronics engineer with a masters degree and 2 years experience. We’ve been told by an immigration agent that the 190 visa is our best bet to move over there, and electronics engineer looks to be on the MLTSSL. However, I’m having trouble getting my head around the state sponsorship aspect. How are 190 visas more likely to be granted than 189? Does the state have access to the skill select database/EOIs and dip in when there’s a particular shortage? And would those with 90+ points not always still get priority, like with the 189?
For info, we’ve already used up our working holiday visas living out there in 2018. I’d be grateful for any insight! Many thanks in advance!",2021-03-30T15:56:46.097Z

2719,1c65rhu,Kindly-Vegetable337,"The reason why 482 is going under drastic changes is because employers are misusing this visa a lot.
Imagine a position for senior software developer advertised on SEEK with low pay than current market, this position wont be taken up by any sane people onshore because of pay rate and working condition. The employer can show that job has been up for months with no one to hire, then they can move on to offshore candidate who will take up job with shit pay as working condition is better and pay rate is better compared to home country.
This has happened a lot to almost many of IT, accounting and engineering sector which collectively brings national wage down even though there is actually no skill shortage. Which is why JSA is including only those occupation who has actual shortage and needs 482 visa.
There are hardly any invite without experience in 190 except nursing, some states do need commitment otherwise it will ruin chances to citizenship, I do agree with last point which should be applied to both 189/190.",2024-04-17T09:59:04.766Z
2720,1c65rhu,Extension-Active4025,"Largely it's an excellent idea. The 482 has been pretty abused previously. It is straightforward for family owned companies to pick family from abroad to work for them. It has been exploited in many professions, IT as the prime example, to suppress wages by hiring immigrants on wages far below standard, and falsely claiming a role to be in shortage when in truth it isnt. A lot of the roles on there need culling, from 2 aspects too. Some, like hospitality management, is neither in shortage, nor warrants the need to hire abroad instead of locally, it's not skilled enough per se.
Secondly, and I really hope changes to the SOL for the 189/190/491 are updated after this too, a bunch of professions are listed which frankly stand no chance of success. Jobs which aren't in demand, and aren't getting invites. Heaps of cases of queries on this sub of people asking their chances for obscure profession X. Its exploitative to applicants paying for skills assessments that stand no chance, and it's good that can hopefully be largely stopped. If these jobs come back in need, add them back. When thinks aren't in need, remove them promptly.
Some of the changes are actually super beneficial to those on them. 6 months is a realistic timeframe to find new employment if some issue arises in sponsorship. 60 days currently is wishful thinking. There will apparently be much clearer routes to PR too.
You make great points about 190 especially and the 491, but I dont think they are abused near as much. Except medicine and nursing, pretty much all the 190 roles require X years experience. Similarly, for most skilled professions it's unlikely (but possible still) they will change from what they are skilled in. Wholeheartedly agree that rules to stay in a state for a period are a great idea.
Remains to be seen how the changes unfold, but overall seems a big step in the right direction. One likely to be popular in the eyes of the electorate too, as it will cut numbers, cut the BS or a good portion, and get in the jobs actually needed.",2024-04-17T14:15:47.919Z

2777,1do2979,awndrwmn,"Differences to NZ WHV (from what I read so far):
Documents must be attached to the form before submission and payment (NZ: the application form must be submitted, and the application fee must be paid before submitting evidence).
An application cannot be submitted without the required uploads (NZ: no need to upload anything). There are 200 places instead of 100. Australia has a page where you can see all the country caps, and it gets updated from time to time (NZ: you need to check the per-country page).
Australia pauses intake if the country cap is close to being filled, if there's a high volume of applications, or if other reasons mean the program cannot be opened. It advises checking the status page occasionally (NZ: It is unknown if NZ does the same; they may not announce it).
Country caps open simultaneously at the start of the financial year (NZ: Different dates for different countries).
The minimum health and character requirements appear to be more stringent (NZ: full medical is optional or required only if declaring major illnesses; a PCC is not required since it's only a one-year visa unless character issues are declared).
There appear to be more options for meeting the functional English requirement (NZ: English test, CEMI from college/uni).
Shorter study duration allowed (NZ: 6 months).
Education requirements appear to be lower (NZ: Must be least a 3-year post-secondary program).
A more expensive application fee (NZ: 455 or Php 16,400).
Biometrics may be required. The Philippines is included in Australia's biometrics program. (NZ: no biometrics required).
Onshore applications are not allowed—if you are in Australia on a different visa (except very limited visa types) during processing, the visa can't be issued while onshore (NZ: both allowed for PHWHV).
Longer time with an employer (NZ: 3 months).
Eligibility for second and third 462 visas is 12 months each if the requirements are met (NZ: 3 months only).
More expensive in every aspect :)) (NZ: cheaper).
There does not seem to be a ""race"" in the sense that you can't just speed through the application form if you don't have everything yet, but it could be a race if everyone has everything ready already (NZ: a ""race"").
Medical insurance is suggested, but it is not a requirement.
Similarities:
Some countries fill their quotas quickly even within days of opening. (Aus: Start of financial year, NZ: Specific opening date per country)
There is an age limit of 18-30 years old.
Longer stays may be possible if you work in specific industries. Aus | NZ
Health tests may be completed before applying but don't guarantee approval.
Multiple entries are allowed.
12 consecutive months stay, time spent outside the country isn't added back.
One year to enter the country from approval.
Dependent children are not allowed.
Family members cannot be included in the application.
It is a legal requirement, to be honest and not submit fake documents or misleading information.
FYIs:
If you have used ImmiAccount before, you may know you cannot delete documents once they are uploaded. Please exercise caution when uploading your documents.
You will need a HAP ID to undergo the health tests. This is usually found within the referral letter sent to you, notifying you of the health checks you must do after applying for the visa. The step-by-step page on the Australian immigration website, however, mentions organising health checks before filling out a form. Ensuring that you take the right tests may be confusing, especially for someone unfamiliar with Australian immigration regulations. If you decide to do the health checks before applying, please get the correct advice for your circumstances from a registered migration agent or immigration lawyer.
There will be system maintenance of Aus immigration systems from 2 PM AEST on 30 June 2024 until 9 AM AEST on 1 July 2024.
Please create your ImmiAccount as soon as possible! 😊

For visas that do allow family sponsorship, like certain types of tourist visas, the sponsor must be a partner, parent, child, sibling, aunt/uncle, or a niece/nephew. Cousins are usually not able to do this, unless there are very specific circumstances involved. For example, lets say for example that you live in Australia and you would like to sponsor your cousin to come for a visit. This is not allowed.

2858,17dughj,washingtonpost,"Some GOP presidential candidates have called to revoke student visas and deport foreign nationals who express support for Palestinians or criticize Israel’s military response
As tensions have erupted at college campuses throughout the country after Hamas’s attack on Israel, former president Donald Trump and other Republican presidential candidates have called to revoke student visas and deport foreign nationals who express support for Palestinians or criticize Israel’s military response — moves that would amount to violations of their First Amendment rights, according to some legal experts.
Student protests have ranged from urging a cease-fire or denouncing the treatment and killing of Palestinian civilians to blaming Israel for Hamas’s attack, a position that has been criticized across the political spectrum. Some Republican candidates have not differentiated the protests in their comments, generalizing protest participants as supporting Hamas.Trump, the dominant polling leader in the GOP race, said this week that if he is returned to the White House, his administration would revoke student visas of “radical, anti-American and antisemitic foreigners.”
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) also expressed support for deporting international students who he deems supportive of Hamas, saying, “You don’t have a right to be here on a visa. You don’t have a right to be studying in the United States.”
In a radio interview the same day, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said of student protests: “If any of those students on college campuses are foreign nationals on a visa, they should be sent back to their country.”
The proposals reflect the determination by much of the GOP field to stake out increasingly hard-line stances against many Muslim immigrants and in support of Israel, with candidates saying the United States should not accept any refugees from Gaza — where Israel has cut off electricity, food and fuel in response to Hamas’s deadly attack.
The scrutiny on students and their response to the war triggered by Hamas’s strike also reflects the inclination by many Republicans to direct criticism toward universities and campus communities they have frequently clashed with on cultural issues.
Many Republicans have positioned themselves as stalwart defenders of free speech, often alleging that conservative views are muted at colleges and universities. Republicans’ posture on student protesters conflicts with that stance, some immigration and civil rights advocates said. Those advocates also cautioned that such proposals dangerously conflate protesters who criticize Israel’s response to Hamas’s attack or voice concern for Palestinians with those supporting Hamas — the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip.
“The First Amendment protects the right to speak of all people who live in this country, whether they’re here as citizens, whether they’re here as foreign nationals, whether they’re students, whether they’re visitors,” said David Cole, the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union and a law professor at Georgetown University. “The First Amendment prohibits the government from punishing someone for their speech or their association. And so I think they’re nonstarters.”
The Trump, DeSantis and Scott campaigns did not respond to questions seeking more detailed explanations of how to reconcile the proposals with the Constitution’s protection of free speech or how they would determine which students they classify as anti-Israel or pro-Hamas.

Immigration was sold to Canadians as helping improve affordability of life and quality of life as it would help fund social programs. It has put us in one of the deepest housing crisis we have ever known in this nation alongside a general affordability of life/quality of life crisis. How does this help our seniors and other vulnerable communities survive?
It doesn't. It took alienated and struggling demographics and completely divorced them from the system. Now we have record high food bank usage, shelters are full, and tent slums continue to grow every fucking month. Every single story now in Canada is about how hard it is to simply survive. If you don't come from generational wealth or have a safety housing net it is impacting peoples mental health to the point of break downs. We have rising rates of depression and anxiety year after year. Substance abuse keeps going up. These are not the signs of a mentally healthy society.
This doesn't even mention the ethnic, religious, and political conflicts we have imported to our streets.
My god have you seen the prices of bachelor suites and one bedroom apartments? The very basics of housing? We still can't get our corrupt city, provincial, and federal leaders to work together and with private sector to get mass medium and high density housing construction actually going to help us..
Immigration is massively abused for cheap exploitable labor and a larger consumer base for higher profits that a class that already has no problems got to enjoy all the fruits of. Sadly our political leaders from city, provincial, and federal levels are usually part of this class or buddy buddy with it and this is why it took them so long to even acknowledge the housing crisis existed despite how loud and how long the voices of pain and suffering were here in Canada.
The international student program is so bad for misuse and abuse of our food banks some food banks have stopped allowing this demographic to use their services. That and the need is too high. Maybe our standards are not correct for this program...? We also have the sickening videos and other things we all know about in regards to how to rip off these services and support systems floating around..
Temporary Foreign Worker Program - My god Justin and Singh talked about this themselves. Then in power they made it a million times worse. We already had one scandal here and this one is much much bigger. Funny how money and power corrupt..
Lastly the ""refugee"" and ""asylum"" pathways. My god we saw how these were exploited and scammed across the world. Did we decide to tighten our borders? Did we decide to plan ahead?
NOPE
Now we have this whole program massively scammed to high heavens and people that are not even Canadian citizens are filling our shelters, being put up in hotels, and making government spending at city, provincial, and federal level even higher.
I guess though as long as all of this profits the wealth class that involves politicians and private sector leaders it is all okay though right?
All the negative societal costs going on the middle class backs that are barely above water at this point.
We need to get back to common sense and basic math.
If you bring in vastly more people than you do housing development in a year that is going to cause issues around accessibility and affordability.
If that continues year after year that is going to lead to a crisis of accessibility and affordability of housing.
This same basic math goes for all societal infrastructure.
Politicians and associated organizations lie and mislead all the time.
Basic math does not.
We can't take care of the rest of the world and have no standards.
We have our own people sleeping in tents like refugee camps in third world countries.
We have our own people skipping meals and record high food bank usage.

It’s highly unlikely you’ll need any evidence of English for the visa. Being from Germany it’s not required at the time of lodgement.

""If we're going to have a discussion about increasing the skilled migration rate, it's got to be coupled with a discussion about housing and real investments, so we've got a home for everyone who comes here,"" she said.

Extract from a letter to the editor in the Melbourne Age the other week -
...The Australian economy cannot return to the past unsustainable ponzi scheme of pouring in more and more immigrants as a lazy way to maintain positive growth. Our major cities are full and under infrastructure and environmental stress. Pouring in more migrants to the levels of the past will just exacerbate the situation and negatively impact the already strained liveability . The solution needs to be a mixture of development of local skills and a temepered immigration program to fill the genuine gaps.
Comments from Bob Carr in 2017
..Carr says that by the early 2000s the NSW government was spending about double what it had been in the 1990s on infrastructure and still struggling to keep up with increasing demands.
He dismissed the argument that the population growth could be accommodated with better planning. “Any idiot can say ‘it’s just a matter of infrastructure’, as though nobody had thought of that before.
“Every suburb of Sydney, except those with political protection like Point Piper and Ku-ring-gai, is being transformed.”
Carr also challenges the argument that high immigration benefited the nation by sustaining growth. “It is a pretty lazy growth model. It is as if we have given up any innovation for an economy based on throwing up apartment blocks and shopping malls.”
He believes high immigration is being sustained politically due to the disconnect between those who benefit and those who pay – federal governments benefit from economic growth immigration spurs, while a handful of state governments foot the bill.
“It is effectively a Canberra conspiracy against the rest of the nation…
Carr does not believe that new immigrants can be encouraged to spread across the nation either, in part because unlike the United States it does not have a vast inland river system. Population, he says, will continue to gravitate to the south-east, which will soon attain levels of density “you can’t even imagine”.",2022-09-02T01:36:13.075Z

Damn, lots of mad Americans replied to my post! Too many to catch you all, so I'm editing for one and all.
First off, no I'm not anti-American, I'm anti-being lectured about covid by a country that completely botched their covid response.
Second, the thing about having a totalitarian dictatorship in Australia is that this is a fabrication by right wing media for the consumption of low IQ gullible twats. Here's the real story that Fox news doesn't want you to know:
- Part of the country has had lockdowns for part of the pandemic in order to prevent our hospital systems being overwhelmed.
- Many if not most Western nations also had lockdowns, Australia is nothing special in this regard.
- The reason that we were having lockdowns after all the other countries that also had lockdowns cancelled their lockdowns is because our Federal government failed to roll out the vaccines on schedule. Back in June 2021 when Delta struck Australia just about everyone in the US and UK had been vaccinated if they wanted and we were at something like 10% vaccinations.
- Now we're hitting our vaccination targets, our two most populous states, NSW and Victoria, have opened back up.
That's it, that's the whole story. Lockdowns like everyone else that had lockdowns, but later on because of an incompetent Federal government. Lockdowns that either have now ended or were never imposed beyond a few days for the majority of the Australian population.
Stop being hysterical Americans, there is literally nothing to see here...except of course a lesson in how to manage pandemics.

https://www.smh.com.au/national/abbott-speech-shows-his-boat-people-paranoia-20151028-gkkind.html
Despite being elected in 2007 with a commitment to continue boat turn-backs, the green-Left inside the Rudd Labor administration had its way. Turn-backs ceased, and offshore detention and temporary visas were abolished – only for the boats, predictably enough, to start up again. Over the next six years, more than 800 boats came to Australia, with nearly 50,000 people aboard. At least 1,000 are thought to have died in the attempt. At its peak, there were 5,000 arrivals in one month alone.
When I became prime minister in 2013, I knew something had to be done to fix this. What changed? First, offshore processing in Nauru and also in Papua New Guinea resumed. Most significantly, Operation Sovereign Borders commenced. My government built on the Howard formula: boat turn-backs to stop people leaving for Australia in the first place, offshore processing so that those who were picked up at sea never made it to Australia, and temporary visas so that those who did get here couldn’t stay.
Crucially, we added a unified command structure under military leadership for all the agencies involved, a media blackout for individual boat arrivals (because this had served as “shipping news for people smugglers”), and – when boats were scuttled, forcing our navy to pick up their occupants – putting would-be migrants on to unsinkable lifeboats just outside Indonesia’s 12-mile limit with only enough fuel to make it back to Java.
At the beginning, only one of the government’s most senior officials thought that stopping the boats was even achievable. One of them went so far as to claim that it could cause conflict with Indonesia. My response was that if illegal boats were leaving Australia for Indonesia, with only perfunctory efforts made to stop them, the Indonesians would regard us as conniving in an unfriendly act.
When official advice emerged that the turn-backs might be illegal under international law, I demanded we seek better advice. A country that can’t stop people entering without permission is suffering a form of peaceful invasion.",2024-02-16T21:58:50.770Z

The trouble is, very few migrants arriving in Australia come with the skills to build the extra homes we need.
Migrants are less likely to work in construction than in most other industries. About 32% of Australian workers were foreign born, but only about 24% of workers in building and construction were born overseas.
And very few recent migrants work in construction. Migrants who arrived in Australia less than five years ago account for just 2.8% of the construction workforce, but account for 4.4% of all workers in Australia.

January is a slow news month in Australia, particularly when it comes to economic and business matters. Most business leaders have headed for the beach or overseas to ski down pristine slopes. A few will head to Davos next week to attend the latest World Economic Forum confab.
Seeing a gap in the market, audit and consulting firm KPMG has taken to releasing an annual survey of a small number of senior business figures in early January. Entitled Keeping Us Up at Night, the short report outlines the main factors that are concerning the respondents. Note here that most of KPMG’s clients are big businesses and government departments.
According to the results, top concerns for the next 12 months and the next three to five years are “dealing with cyber risks, and talent issues, including recruitment/retention and upskilling the workforce for a digital world”.
KPMG chief economist Brendan Rynne provided additional commentary to the report, including a plea to the government to refrain from cutting the migrant intake. “We’ve got to be careful that we don’t have a knee-jerk reaction and I think that the government’s response hasn’t been: it’s been considered and positive.”
He noted the “work we’ve done has consistently shown that skilled migration adds positively to the Australian economy and it does that through improvements in productivity.”
Referring to the acute shortage of housing, he added: “I’d actually live with the short-term challenges that we’ve got at the moment. I think ultimately that the market will sort itself out with regard to housing investment and I’d rather do that than turn away skilled migrants who are unlikely to come back later.”
But are any of these assertions consistent with the evidence? And just to be picky, I’m pretty sure Rynne personally is not living with the short-term challenges – for example, lining up to secure high-priced rental accommodation.
Consider the supposed link between skilled migration and higher productivity, leading to broad economic benefits. Notwithstanding Rynne telling us he has work that demonstrates this link, there is little rigorous Australian research to back the claim. Indeed, in terms of recent trends, the evidence is the opposite: the surging rates of migrant intake that occurred in the 2010s and have restarted after the Covid-induced lull have been associated with sluggish productivity growth, much lower than was apparent in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The immediate effect of immigration is to dilute the capital stock, which has a negative effect on productivity. It is only over time that this capital-shallowing effect can be offset by investment. The sad reality is, absent the mining sector, this investment has failed to materialise in Australia.
Throughout this recent period, governments have emphasised skilled migration in relation to the permanent migrant intake. Of the 190,000 permanent annual places, 137,000 or 72 per cent are allocated to the skill stream, with the remaining to the family stream (mainly partner visas). This high percentage of skilled migration has been a pattern for many years.
But the permanent intake is only a proportion of the total migrant intake. According to the latest figures, there were more than 500,000 long-term net migrant arrivals in the year ending in June 2023. The permanent intake is only 40 per cent of the total number of new migrants. In turn, most migrant arrivals are international students who cannot be deemed skilled although they do take unskilled and semi-skilled jobs. To be sure, there are temporary workers among the intake and some of them are highly skilled, but not all.
The number of international student visas granted in 2022-23 was more than 550,000. In addition, there were nearly 200,000 temporary graduate visa holders in June last year, an increase of more than 100 per cent on the June 2022 figure.
It may be tempting to equate graduates with skilled workers, but we know from a range of data sources that the employment of international graduates is much less concentrated in professional and managerial occupation than domestic graduates. According to a survey of graduate outcomes in 2022, 58 per cent of international graduates were employed full time compared with close to 80 per cent of domestic graduates. The median salary of international graduates employed full time was less than 90 per cent of domestic graduates. The reality is, many international graduates are employed in semi-skilled, routine jobs.
Rynne may have a point for specific cases where particular skills are required for certain investments to go ahead or for certain firms to grow. But we are talking about relatively small numbers where the employer-sponsored visa categories deal with these needs. In any case, a better and more sustainable solution is for firms to invest in the training of workers with these specialised skills rather than simply bringing in migrant workers.
As for the housing market adjusting to market forces and provid­ing ample, affordable accommodation for the rapidly growing population driven by immigration, again the evidence doesn’t favour Rynne’s sanguinity. If anything, market forces are working in the opposite direction, with rising interest rates, higher material costs, worker shortages and planning/approval delays leading to far fewer homes being built than are required.
Indeed, there were fewer new apartments built last year than had been the case for more than a decade. The housing situation is not just a short-term challenge. There is a widespread consensus that the federal government’s target of 1.2 million homes to be built across five years will not be met.
As for the government’s response to the surging migrant intake, actions taken thus far have been feeble and small-scale, even though the rate of immigration is unpopular with voters. The hope is that the net overseas migration figure will settle back to levels deemed to be acceptable – about 250,000 a year, which is still high.
But a few regulatory tweaks will not fix the problem, particularly as many on temporary visas are highly capable of gaming the system. Witness the recent uptick in applications for humanitarian visas as an example.
The bottom line is this: the surge in net overseas migration is unsustainable; overwhelmingly, the new migrants are not skilled; and the pressures on the housing market will not ease noticeably until the migrant intake is deliberately and substantially reduced.
Big businesses, universities and property developers will vocally oppose any moves to restrict immigration because it is not in their interests to do so.
It’s also important to acknowledge the effects of large migrant intakes extend well beyond the labour market and housing. They include more congestion, greater demand on facilities such as schools, hospitals and utilities, and the loss of social amenity. The government needs to consider this broader picture and to act with haste to rein in the migrant intake as well as speed up the exit of many temporary migrants.",2024-01-09T02:48:12.661Z

The students had been told they were admitted to a well known post-secondary school, entered Canada on student visas, then were told by the recruiter that the university no longer had space, so they would have to attend private colleges.
After completing their studies, border services accused the students of committing fraud and sent out 700 deportation notices. While the government stepped in to freeze the order, a number had already left—some voluntarily, others by force.
Considering Indian media covered the issue extensively, Canada likely developed a reputation overseas. At least when it comes to smaller, lesser known schools.

Furthermore:
In time for the fall 2024 semester, IRCC will adopt a “recognized institution” framework to benefit post-secondary DLIs that set a higher standard for services, support and outcomes for international students.
There’s more. But overall, this was in the making for a while. People are pissed and the government is acting.

I also feel that there should be waaaay more checks and balances in place by the government. There are far too many “international students” getting into Canada on falsified acceptance letters and even though some have been caught and deported, those numbers are a drop in a bucket into the amount who are still here. They are not in school. They are not in classes. They are not in the schools they said they were accepted into and used fraudulent information to gain access into Canada. They are just here working under false pretenses. There should be some sort of check on each student with each school confirming they are here and attending school. If not, they are deported for fraudulently entering Canada under false pretenses.
The last thing is that schools should not pass students who do not show up or do not do the work. All you hear is students not doing the work and still getting degrees. That makes a joke out of our education system and degrades the degrees of those students who actually do the work and show up.

While I realize this is a provincial issue, I currently don’t have an MPP to ask…(Kitchener Center) Are the colleges under any obligation to ensure scaled medical/health care supports for their student population?

I would add that there should be something in there that addresses fraud (like people paying others to pass their English tests) and the impact that has in education for domestic students. We cannot be lowering standards to accommodate people who don’t have a good grasp of English. It’s not just bad for the economy, as having a poorly educated population leads to skill shortages, but it also devalues credentials and wastes people’s time and money. There are students who worked very hard over many years to get their degrees from Conestoga 10 years ago who now have to deal with employers writing off their education as being from a “diploma mill”. This is so beyond unacceptable. With growth in technology I don’t understand the obsession that colleges have with growing and building new campuses. Why does everything have to grow? Quality over quantity would be a better approach. And by the way, this was a problem 01 years ago and when I wrote my MPP about it I was told that Ontario has “world-class education”.

3253,1duusf5,Desperate-Grab-8926,"Hey, so although you can definitely apply on your own as an international to Australian Universities, I actually recommend you go through an agency to help you with this process.
As a Canadian, I personally went through OzTREKK, an agency that specializes in helping Canadian and American students apply to programs (eg. Medicine) in Australia and New Zeeland. You can schedule a call with them and they will essentially take you through the entire process, even going through your transcript and telling you which universitates you are competitive for. They also will handle all your applications on your behalf, and work with you through the entire process at no cost.
I think given your particular situation, they might also give you advice on how proceed as an international student studying in the US and what resources are available for you. I will also mention that you do not need to sit the GAMSAT (unless you need to for a personal reason), all Canadian and American internationals applying to postgraduate medical programs in Australia are assessed based on GPA and MCAT (Here is a table for the 2024 GPA 4.0 scale and MCAT requirements from OzTREKK)

I believe the Dublin.ie post means that you do not need to apply for a student visa prior to your arrival into Ireland because of visa waiver entry, but because you'll be staying here for the purpose of study and that's over the allotted 90 days of a waiver then yes, you pop along to INIS (which is an ordeal tbh) and tell them you're here to study, and then, you are issued with the visa permission to stay.

3348,1cqy0rd,Th3Varangian,"I’m a U.S. student who studied in Ireland for my masters. The university you’re going to study at will have more information (and paperwork) on the process. The short version is though, you do not need a visa to study, but you will need to provide evidence to immigration that you have been accepted to the university, have the financial means to support yourself (grants, loans, job), and that you have a place to live. After you arrive in Ireland, you’ll get an email from the international office at your university asking to sign up for an appointment with the nearest immigration office. Once you have the appointment immigration will do a quick interview to confirm all the documents I mentioned above, take your photo, and issue you a residence card. You’re allowed to study and work up to 20 (I think, might be a bit more) hours per work. Your residency status can be renewed as long as you’re in school, and up to one year post schooling if you’re actively seeking full time employment. After that, I’m not sure what the process is.

3365,12o3f7v,roosterEcho,"For Visa 485 (post study work visa) the English language requirement is as follows:
- IELTS: Overall score of at least 6 with a minimum score of 5 for each of the 4 parts (Reading, Listening, Writing, Speaking)
- PTE: Overall score of at least 50 with a minimum score of 36 for each of the 4 parts.
You should already have a language test result that you used for your Australian study. Check the expiry date for that one, you might not have to seat for one again. The result is usually valid for 3 years.
IELTS and PTE are the primary tests everyone prefers. PTE is relatively easier, but for the requirements of this visa, both are easy to get the desired score. Both tests have an academic and a general version. For Australia, only PTE Academic is available, which costs $385*. The price may vary a little depending on which organisation you're registering with. You can seat for IELTS general training (academic one is harder, not needed for 485). IELTS General Training costs $395*. Again, this might vary a little depending on which organisation you're registering with. By registration organisation, I mean, there are multiple organisations that arrange the tests on behalf of Pearson (PTE) or British Council (IELTS). You'll see the list when you're booking and can choose the nearest test centre to you. Best of luck!

3369,15ugx7u,sah10406,"I think some different matters are getting mixed up here, and it’s not just you. So much misinformation is being generated and recycled.
Here’s the tea. A Student Visa requires you to be in the UK during term time participating in your course. The university monitors that. If you want or need to leave the UK during term-time, you need to check that the university agrees to that. If they don’t, and you leave anyway, they could in theory withdraw sponsorship for the Student visa. Seems harsh, and it probably hardly ever happens.
There is no separate or differently-counted requirement around term-time absence for the Graduate visa. There is the “Study in the UK” requirement, but by confirming to the Home Office that you are eligible to apply for a Graduate visa, the university is confirming that you meet the “Study in the UK” requirement, i.e. that you were studying in the UK when they required you to be. The university monitors your attendance and absence. The Home Office has no separate interest in it, unless the university instructs them to cancel your Student visa for lack of engagement with your studies.
The idea that the Home Office is doing a deep-dive check of every Graduate applicants’ travel to try to catch them travelling during term-time and refuse their visa is a big myth. In some versions of the story they are even trying to catch people travelling in vacations! It’s all nonsense. It is passed around as gossip and won’t go away. It seems to be based on a misunderstanding and conflation of the aforementioned “Study in the UK” requirement and the “world travel history” question on the application. The latter is a standard question on every UK visa and leave to remain application, and is nothing whatsoever to do with eligibility for the Graduate visa.
I work in this field and I have seen detailed data on Graduate visa refusals. First, there are hardly any. Second, they are almost all because someone applied before they had their eligible qualification, sometimes part-way through the course. And like with all types of visa there is a tiny number refused under the General grounds for criminality, etc. There are no refusals for absence from the UK during term time - if that was a problem, the university would have triggered cancellation of the Student visa anyway.
And breathe.",2023-08-18T13:22:01.457Z
3370,15ugx7u,clever_octopus,"Taking a holiday abroad between terms does not affect your eligibility for a Graduate Visa, the Easter break is not consequential.
You can return to the UK as long as your visa is valid, but if you have finished your course, then there is a small risk it could be cancelled at the border due to the fact that your visa terms no longer apply. If your course end date is the 17th and you are due to return on the 16th, then I highly doubt it will be a problem",2023-08-18T10:44:58.329Z

3380,1d4sws5,Gmaz94,"I was in a slightly similar situation, I did a master's overseas then returned to Australia to work. I loved the experience of studying overseas! So that's something you should factor in - will you enjoy the course and your life outside the classroom more at UTS than on another similar program (in your country or in another country)?
The other questions I would be asking is how you think this degree will be received when you return home and what the job market is like where you're from. Remember that a behavioural economics degree could lead down a few paths (behavioural eco, yes, but also market research and insights work, policy work, more eco or finance work and probably other things) - so you can think about what associated things you might be interested in persuing and look at the markets for those as well.
It's really great that you have identified a couple of things you know you are less interested in! My advice would be to avoid those - if behavioural economics is what you're most interested in then at least this master's will be more interesting and fun for you than any other masters. And then at the end you will be on track to work somewhere more aligned with that. Clinical psych is a tough grind - I definitely don't think you would want to do that unless you're super into it.
(Note that the whole ""follow your passions"" advice is contingent on a certain amount of financial and other types of security so make the call that's right for you!)
Finally, I don't know anything about working without a visa in the BI industry - apologies. Sponsorship may be an option but I hear it's tricky and does tie you to an employer for a long time, which can be disadvantageous. There is probably a visa Reddit (or outside Reddit source!) that could tell you more.

With that context: you're going at this backwards. First you need to figure out what career makes sense for your life, considering your aptitudes, interests, national (for you) and global trends, and only then figure out how to get there.
A degree without a plan and goal is a waste of time and money.
About this specific degree, my opinion is that it's highly unlikely to increase your career prospects, because no one is clamoring to hire Economics Masters degree holders, and because BE as a field has had some reputational setbacks recently. But this last paragraph doesn't matter - before starting any other degree, first you need to have a goal in mind.
For general career advice, there are probably more helpful subreddits to ask your question. And you'll get better answers if you reveal where you're from and where you want to live in the future.",2024-06-09T15:39:42.017Z

BUT there's this thing where you get a 28 day grace period after your visa expires which means you don't get the 3 year ban from the country, but you are here illegally. I think if you let your visa run out, enter this 'grace period' then apply for second WHV from 1st July, this works?

If you're not worried about extending your visa and you don't mind working hospitality stuff then a big city is a good place to start. But keep in mind that the Australian rental market is pretty absurd right now so finding a flat can be quite difficult (or so I've been told).
If you want to extend your visa you basically have to go somewhere rural. It's also a good option to save money since some jobs will offer room and board if you commit to a period of time. But you might end up in a working hostel to do your days/save some money and that experience can really depend on your personality. I personally loved it, but I also know people who went home/gave up after a few weeks.

3629,188w83x,igormuba,"Nice. They will have visa free travel again when they allow Brazilians to travel visa free too, like the Japanese did. Reciprocity is key to international relations 🤝
Although because it is e-visa it is still too easy compared to what Brazilians have to go through to get visas to those countries",2023-12-02T05:20:05.126Z
